This page provides links to JavaDocs for connected system plug-ins.
For full connected system plug-ins reference, visit our JavaDocs:
- Core contains data contracts for how connected system plug-ins communicate with Appian
- Client streamlines creation of templates by assembling and managing the data contracts for you 
Recommendation: Always start your development with Client.  Method signatures will indicate when a class from Core must be used.
Find the current version of Core and Client to use on the SDK Version Compatibility page.
