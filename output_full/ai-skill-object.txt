Overview
An AI skill is a design object that enables you to build, configure, and train an artificial intelligence (AI) model using Appian low-code capabilities.
This page discusses the basic features and functionality of the AI Skills design object.
Create an AI skill
To create an AI skill:

In the Build view, click NEW > AI Skill.

Configure the following properties:
|Property|Description|
|-|-|
| Name | Enter a name that follows the recommended naming standard. |
| Description | (Optional) Enter a brief description of the AI skill. |
1. Click CREATE.


The AI skill opens in a new dialog or window, where you can choose the skill type and add document types.
Skill types

As you create an AI skill, you'll select the type of skill that suits your purpose.

Classify Documents
Extract from Documents (coming soon)
Predict Trend (coming soon)

You'll configure your skill based on its type.
Design guidance
The AI Skill design object is not versioned. However, as you train your skill, you can review the results and create a new model using additional sample data. During this refinement process, each model is preserved in the training summary. 
You can access the training summary to view details on model creation history and how the skill was refined to its current state.
Using an AI skill in a process
After you train the skill and determine a model's predictions are suitable for your purposes, you'll publish the model. The published model is what the Classify Documents smart service uses when it calls the AI Skill in a process model.

Only one model can be published at a time within an AI Skill design object.

You'll call an AI skill in a process model using the smart services in the AI Skill menu of the palette.

1. In your application, go to the Build view.
2. Select the checkbox of the AI skill you want to delete.
3. Click Delete.
4. Review any object dependents and click DELETE.
