Usage considerations
Archived and deleted processes are not included.
The current user must hold viewer rights or higher authority for the specified process model, in order to execute this function.
If you do not provide a value for the includeSubProcessData parameter, the default value is taken from the current context or set to false if no subprocesses available.

For example, if the function is used on a Web Content with Process Details Channel and the channel's context includes subprocesses, these subprocesses are included by default.
