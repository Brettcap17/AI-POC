Usage considerations
Displaying values and offline use

Each column displays items in alphabetical order, with folders always listed first.
Avoid using this component for offline mobile forms because tapping on a folder does not display its contents.

Permissions

The current user must have permission to view the selected items.
Within a folder or knowledge center, the user can only see contents for which they have permission to view.

Examples
Copy and paste an example into the INTERFACE DEFINITION in EXPRESSION MODE to see it displayed.
