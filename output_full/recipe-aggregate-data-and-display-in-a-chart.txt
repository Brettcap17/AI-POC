This scenario demonstrates:

How to aggregate data and display in a pie chart.

Create this pattern
You can easily create this pattern in Design Mode when you use a record type as the source of your chart. 
To create this pattern in Design Mode:

Open a new or empty interface object.
From the PALETTE, drag a Pie Chart component into the interface.
From Data Source, select RECORD TYPE and search for the Employee record type.
Under Primary Grouping, select the department field.
Under Measure, use the dropdown to select Count of, then select the id field.
Under Style, use the dropdown to select Pie.

{% include zoompic.html url="images/pie-chart-config.gif" %}
Your resulting expression will look something like this:
sail
{
  a!pieChartField(
    data: recordType!Employee,
    config: a!pieChartConfig(
      primaryGrouping: a!grouping(
        field: recordType!Employee.fields.department,
        alias: "department_primaryGrouping"
      ),
      measures: {
        a!measure(
          function: "COUNT",
          field: recordType!Employee.fields.id,
          alias: "id_count_measure1"
        )
      },
      dataLimit: 100
    ),
    label: "Pie Chart",
    labelPosition: "ABOVE",
    colorScheme: "CLASSIC",
    style: "PIE",
    seriesLabelStyle: "ON_CHART",
    height: "MEDIUM",
    refreshAfter: "RECORD_ACTION"
  )
}
Notable implementation details

This chart will aggregate on the entire data set. To aggregate and filter a chart, see Aggregate Data using a Filter and Display in a Chart.
