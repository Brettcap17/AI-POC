Example

The Employee record type has a grossSalary field, which contains each employee's salary amount. The Benefits record type has a deductions field, which determines the deduction amount based on the selected benefits plan.
To calculate each employee's net salary, you could create a custom record field on the Employee record type that evaluates in real-time so you can reference the related record field from the Benefits record type in your calculation. 
The expression would look something like this:
sail
a!customFieldSubtract( 
  value1: recordType!Employee.fields.grossSalary,
  value2: recordType!Employee.relationships.benefits.fields.deductions
)
