Usage considerations
Tasks without a deadline are also counted.
The current user must hold at least viewer rights for the specified process model, in order to execute this function.
Deleted and archived process instances are not counted.
If you do not provide a value for the includeSubProcessData parameter, the default value is taken from the current context or set to false if no subprocesses available.
For example, if the function is used on a Web Content with Process Details Channel and the channel's context includes subprocesses, these subprocesses are included by default.
