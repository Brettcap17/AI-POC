Overview
{{ page.excerpt }} Any fields not modified will retain their previous information. If you do not select a user, any changes made are applied to the user running the node.

appian-style-note
The Update User Profile Service Node can only be executed by someone who is a System Administrator. Attempting to modify a user account other than your own, without sufficient user rights generates an error alert for the Process Administrator and pauses the process.

Node outputs
This node does not return any values.
Usage considerations
Consider the following when using this smart service.
General considerations


If the node is run without being assigned to a user (or a group), you must specify values for each of the node inputs. If you want to overwrite all fields, including setting some fields to null, set the Overwrite All Fields input to true. You can either manually enter data into the text field, or generate a value using the Expression Editor. When using the Expression Editor, you can reference and modify process variables, rules, constants, and other data. The expressions then populate your node input values. 


If the node is assigned, the node input values are typed by your assigned user(s) into a form. 


Specific considerations

Supervisor: If the user selected for the Supervisor field has been deactivated since the profile was last updated, an error is thrown and the process pauses by exception until a valid user or no user is entered for the field. 
Locale: The locale code of the user, such as en_US or de. If not provided, defaults to the environment's primary locale.
Time Zone: The time zone ID of the user, such as America_New York or Europe/London. If not provided, defaults to the environment's primary time zone. To find the time zones available on your environment, view the Time Zone options in your User Settings or the Internationalization tab of the Admin Console.
Calendar: The calendar of the user.  If not provided, defaults to the environment's primary calendar. Valid values: gregorian, Epoch A T1, Epoch A T2, Epoch B T1, Epoch B T2, Umm Al Qura.
