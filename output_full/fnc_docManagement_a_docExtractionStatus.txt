       ID of the doc extraction run. In order to check the status, a run must first be started by the Start Doc Extraction smart service.

Doc extraction runs can only be queried by a user with access to the original document, started by the Start Doc Extraction Smart Service.
The Appian Document Extraction page walks you through how to use document extraction functionality together in a process model. See the following list for the other smart services and functions you need to use with the Doc Extraction Status Function:
- Start Doc Extraction Smart Service
- a!docExtractionResult()
- Reconcile Doc Extraction Smart Service
- Admin Console > Document Extraction
Function
{% include fncsyntax.html %}
{{ page.excerpt }}

Returns
Text
The following statuses can be returned:

COMPLETE: Analysis is done and Appian has downloaded the results, you can now proceed to extract results using a!docExtractionResult() or Reconcile Doc Extraction Smart Service.
IN PROGRESS: Analysis is still in progress. Appian recommends checking again in 60 seconds.
INVALID ID:
The provided ID is invalid because:
The ID provided does not match an active doc extraction run.
The user lacks sufficient privileges to see the original document.
The ID provided is a run that has been deleted. Appian will delete document extraction runs after 30 days, or when the total amount of data surpasses 10 GB.


Next steps: Check that the provided ID is valid or start a new doc extraction run on the same document.
ERROR: Internal evaluation error happened during processing.
Next steps: This is the final state for a run, and you cannot access or make updates to the run. See the process model error and logs for details. You can start a new doc extraction run on the same document.

Example
a!docExtractionStatus(docExtractionId: 25)
Where 25 is a valid docExtractionId.
See the Appian Document Extraction page for a full end to end example.
Usage considerations
The doc extraction status can only be accessed by a user who has permissions to the original document.
Appian will delete document extraction runs after 30 days, or when the total amount of data surpasses 10 GB.  If you attempt to access a run that has been deleted, you will see INVALID ID.
