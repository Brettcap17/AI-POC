Function
{% include fncsyntax.html %}
{{ page.excerpt }} Users are shown the start form or first chained attended node and any subsequent chained forms. When the user submits the last form, the chain completes and the original interface is reloaded. Links can be used in charts, grids, hierarchy browsers, images, link fields, milestones, pickers, and rich text.

Usage considerations
Using start process links offline

Start process links will not function on the mobile application on a form that is configured to be available offline.

Examples
Since process model constants are specific to each system, this example does not evaluate in your Test Rules interface. Use it only as a reference.
