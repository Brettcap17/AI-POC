Configuration options
This section contains tab configuration details specific to this smart service. For more information about common configurations see the Process Node Properties page.
Data tab
The data tab displays the node inputs and outputs for the smart service. You can add additional inputs and outputs, if needed. 
Node inputs
The default input is Group.
| Input | Data Type | Required | Multiple |
|-|-|-|-|
| Group | Group | Yes | No |
If the activity is run without being assigned to a user (or a group) you must designate a value for the Group node input. You can either manually enter the group, or a value can be generated using the Expression Editor. When using the Expression Editor, you can reference process variables, incorporate rules and constants, and other data. The expression you create is used at runtime to populate your node input.
If the activity is not assigned, it runs as the user who started the process.
It is also possible to set the unattended task to run as the process designer, which may not be useful for this activity.
Node outputs
The activity does not return any values.
