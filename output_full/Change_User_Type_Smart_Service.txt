Data tab
Node inputs
The following node inputs need to be entered on the Data tab displays the node inputs and node outputs for the Smart Service. You can add additional inputs and outputs, if needed. The default inputs are:
| Input | Data Type | Required | Multiple |
| - | - | - | - |
| User | User | No | No |
| User Type | Integer | Yes | No |
If the node is run without being assigned to a user (or a group) you must specify values for each of the Node Inputs listed in the table above.
You can either manually enter data into the text-field, or a value can be generated using the Expression Editor. For the User Type, select either Basic User or Administrator from the dropdown list. If creating an expression, use 0 for Basic User and 1 for Administrator.
When using the Expression Editor, you can reference and modify Process Variables, rules, constants, and other data. The expressions then populate your Node Input values.
If the node is assigned, the Node Input values are typed by your assigned user(s) into a form.
a!updateUserType()
The Change User Type smart service is available as an expression function that can be executed inside a saveInto on a Interface Component or as part of a Web API.
