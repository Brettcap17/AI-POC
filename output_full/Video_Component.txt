Usage considerations
Supported formats

The video formats supported by this component vary by device and browser. Videos of a format not supported by a device/browser will not play in the device/browser.
WebM and Ogg are supported on Chrome and Firefox.
MP4, 3gp, mov, and mpv are supported on iOS devices.
MP4, 3gp, webm, and mkv are supported on Android devices.
Videos served over HTTP and HTTPS are both supported. For videos that require authentication, we strongly recommend that you set up single sign-on between Appian and the server that hosts the video so that the video can play without requiring the user to authenticate a second time.

Appian Documents
a!videoField() cannot be used to display videos stored as Appian documents.
