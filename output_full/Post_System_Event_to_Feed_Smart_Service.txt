Overview
The Post System Event to Feed Smart Service allows you to automatically publish system events from a designated source (such as your CRM or HR system) to the News feed.
When publishing feed information from your process, you can have the information appear as being attributed to a given system or a specific user.  
Use this activity when you want the information to show it was posted by the system or a specific application. 
Use the Post Event to Feed Smart Service when you want the information to list that it was posted by a specific user. 
You can specify the user context for the activity on the Assignment Tab.

Once posted, system events can only be deleted by system administrators.

Permissions needed
The user designated to run this smart service must have permission to post an entry to the specified feed.
Attempting to complete this task without the proper user rights generates an error message for the process administrator and pauses the process.
