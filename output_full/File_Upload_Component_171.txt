Notes

When a file is uploaded, the component updates with a temporary Document representing the uploaded file. Between the upload and the form submission, the file on the server is an inactive temporary document and not accessible.
When implementing form cancel behavior via a submission, remember that the uploaded file is moved to its target on submission. If this is undesirable in a cancel scenario, it should be deleted (if target is a folder) or reverted via a new version (if the target is a document) by the process after submission.
If a file is uploaded to a form that is never submitted, the temporary file is automatically deleted after thirty days.
If any of the following characters appear in a document's name, they are replaced by underscores: \ / " ; : | ? ' < > *
The user submitting the form must have at least author access to the target folder or document. Any error creating the new document or version causes submission to be canceled and an error to be displayed to the user.
The file upload component only functions on start and task forms. When placed on a record view or report, the field appears but is automatically disabled.
Task forms with one or more file upload fields can only be saved if either no file has been uploaded or every uploaded file has been removed.
