Function
{% include fncsyntax.html %}
Displays the completed, current, and future steps of a process or sequence, such as a user's current step in a wizard or the current state of a business process.
Parameters
{% include parameter_table.html parameters=page.parameters header=page.reftype %}
Usage considerations
Using the active and links parameters

The active parameter can't be 0 or greater than the total number of items in the steps parameter. If it's null, all steps display as future steps. If it's -1, all steps display as completed.
Each item in the links array renders the corresponding item in the steps array as a link. An item in the steps array for which there is a null value or no value in the links array will render as plain text. There is no need to pad the end of the steps array with null.

Number and width of steps

The steps parameter must contain at least two items. We recommend that steps contains no more than seven items.
When viewed on a mobile device, the milestone component scrolls instead of shrinking the step width.

Length of text values

For an easy to read and professional looking interface, use concise text values of similar length. 
The following will be trimmed:
Indentations using tab.
Leading or trailing spaces.
Leading or trailing line breaks.
Two spaces between words will be shortened to one.
There is no maximum character limit for each item in the steps array; however, text is truncated based on the following:
Vertical Orientation: The first three lines of the text displays. The number of characters allowed for each line is determined by the number of steps and the amount of horizontal space for the component.
Horizontal Orientation: Text displays on a single line until it runs out of horizontal space.

Milestone and step color

By default, the milestone bar shows the accent color above completed and current steps and gray above future steps. You can select a custom color for your milestone in the color parameter.
Text colors: 
Active step: black. 
Completed step with no link: light gray. 
Future steps: dark gray. 
Text with a link: accent color.
