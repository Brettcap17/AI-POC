Usage considerations
Saving and displaying values and placeholders

Any nulls in the array passed into selected Documents are not displayed.
The component always saves an array regardless of how many selections have been made.
Whether placeholder text clears on focus or input varies by device and browser.

Permissions and placeholders

The user viewing the picker must have access to view documents passed to the value. Only documents that the viewing user has permissions to see appear in the suggestions list. When folderFilter is not null, the viewing user must have permission to view the filtering folder for any suggestions to be made.
