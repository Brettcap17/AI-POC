Overview
The Post Event to Feed Smart Service allows you to automatically publish events to the News feed. 
When publishing feed information from your process, you can have the information appear as being attributed to a given system or associated with a specific user. 
Use this activity when you want the information to list that it was posted by a specific user. Use the Post System Event to Feed Smart Service when you want the information to list that it was posted by the system or a specific application.

You can specify the user context for the activity on the Assignment Tab.

The user designated to run this smart service will see the system event in his/her news feed only if he/she is specified in the Viewers input.

Once posted, events can only be deleted by system administrators.

Example use case
You have an application that manages a sales cycle with a process that records information on product demonstrations for potential clients. 
When the Account Representative starts a product demo, he/she updates the status of the demo to "In Progress".  Using this smart service, you can have an event feed entry generated automatically when the Account Representative updates this status so other staff members can see additional information on the potential client including the main focus of the demonstration and who is conducting the demonstration.
Permissions needed
The user designated to run this smart service must have permission to post an entry to the specified feed.
Attempting to complete this task without the proper user rights generates an error message for the process administrator and pauses the process.
