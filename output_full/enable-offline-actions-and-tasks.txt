Introduction
Before you can use actions and tasks offline, you first need to set them up.
There are four main steps to enabling offline actions and tasks:

Enable offline mobile in the Admin Console.
Enable offline mobile in the interface object.
For an offline action, use the interface as a start form in a process model.
Configure the site object.

This document provides instructions for how to enable offline actions and tasks.
Enable offline mobile in the Admin Console {#enable-offline-admin}
Before you can configure offline actions and tasks, you first need to enable offline mobile for the environment. This is a setting in the Admin Console.
To enable offline mobile in the Admin Console:

In the Admin Console, under SYSTEM properties, go to Mobile.
Select Enable Offline Mobile and click SAVE CHANGES.

Enable offline mobile in the interface object {#enable-offline-interface}
In order for an action or task to work offline, you need to enable offline mobile in the interface that you are going to use for the action or task.
To enable offline mobile in the interface object:

Open your interface.
Click the settings icon  > Properties.
Select Make Available Offline and click OK.

For an offline action, use the interface as a start form in a process model {#start-form}
Before you can use the action as a site page, you need to set up a process model to use the offline-enabled interface as a start form.

For tasks, you don't need to do anything special when you create your process model. Just make sure the User Input Task node uses an interface that is offline-enabled.

To use the offline-enabled interface as a start form:

Create a process model with a start form.
Use the offline-enabled interface for the start form.

Configure the site object
The final step to enabling offline actions and tasks is to configure the site object to:

Enable the task list.
Use the process model you created as a site page.

Note that offline tasks won't display on task reports.
To configure the site object:

Open the site object.
If you are using offline tasks, under Show Task List, enable the task list.
If you are using offline actions, in the Pages section, add a page to use for the action.
For Type, select Action. 
For Content, select the process model that uses the offline-enabled interface as a start form.
