How to aggregate data by multiple fields and display in a column chart

Create this pattern
You can easily configure a chart in Design Mode when you use a record type as the source. 
To create this pattern in Design Mode:

Open a new or empty interface object.
From the PALETTE, drag a Column Chart component into the interface.
From Data Source, select RECORD TYPE and search for the Employee record type.
Under Primary Grouping, select the department field.
Click ADD GROUPING.
Under Secondary Grouping, select the title field.
Under Measure, use the dropdown to select Count of, then select the id field.
From Stacking, select Normal. 
For the X-Axis Title, enter Department.
For the Y-Axis Title, enter Number of Employees.

Your resulting expression will look something like this:
sail 
  a!columnChartField(
    data: recordType!Employee,
    config: a!columnChartConfig(
      primaryGrouping: a!grouping(
        field: recordType!Employee.fields.department,
        alias: "department_primaryGrouping"
      ),
      secondaryGrouping: a!grouping(
        field: recordType!Employee.fields.title,
        alias: "title_secondaryGrouping"
      ),
      measures: {
        a!measure(
          function: "COUNT",
          field: recordType!Employee.fields.id,
          alias: "id_count_measure1"
        )
      },
      dataLimit: 100
    ),
    label: "Column Chart",
    xAxisTitle: "Department",
    yAxisTitle: "Number of Employees",
    stacking: "NORMAL",
    showLegend: true,
    showTooltips: true,
    labelPosition: "ABOVE",
    colorScheme: "CLASSIC",
    height: "MEDIUM",
    xAxisStyle: "STANDARD",
    yAxisStyle: "STANDARD"
  )
