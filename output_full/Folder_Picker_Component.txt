Usage considerations
Saving and displaying values and placeholders

Any nulls in the array passed to Selected Folders are not displayed.
The component always saves an array regardless of how many selections have been made.
Whether placeholder text clears on focus or input varies by device and browser. 

Filtering and permissions

When the filter folder is used, the filtering folder itself is never suggested.
The user viewing the picker must have access to view folders passed to the value. Only folders that the viewing user has permissions to see appear in the suggestions list. When Folder Filter is not null, the viewing user must have permission to view the filtering folder for any suggestions to be made.
