Overview
{{ page.excerpt }} 
A temporary password will be automatically generated and sent to the email address provided, unless the Send Account Creation Email input is set to false. The temporary password never expires and can only be used once. The user is forced to change the password when they log in for the first time. 
The password parameter has been deprecated in favor of using auto-generated passwords. Existing processes which use the password parameter will continue to be supported.
Permissions needed
