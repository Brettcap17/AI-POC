Overview
The Start Doc Extraction node allows you to start a document extraction run.
Activating this smart service in the process model initiates an asynchronous analysis run in Appian, and immediately returns a Doc Extraction ID. Next, the a!docExtractionStatus() function should be used to check the status of a run. 
The Appian Document Extraction page walks you through how to use document extraction functionality together in a process model. See the following list for the other smart services and functions you need to use with the Start Doc Extraction Smart Service:
- a!docExtractionStatus()
- a!docExtractionResult()
- Reconcile Doc Extraction Smart Service
- Admin Console > Document Extraction
