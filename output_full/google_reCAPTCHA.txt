Test connection
Click the TEST CONNECTION button to verify your credentials are valid for getting a reCAPTCHA score. 
You will still need to configure the a!verifyRecaptcha() behavior in your interface flow. This button only checks to ensure your credentials are valid.
The connection test only checks one credential at a time. If for example, both your project ID and site key are invalid, the error message will only mention the project ID.
