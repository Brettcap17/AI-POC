To build component plug-ins, you'll need an Appian installation to test them. This page walks you through the steps to get your environment up and running so you can develop your first component.

We review all component plug-ins to ensure they meet our standards for customer use. Check the review guidelines and get a pre-approval to make sure you're on the right track before starting your developer setup.

Configure your developer instance

If you don't already have an Appian instance, use the installation guide to install one.
A properly configured dynamic content URL is required to use component plug-ins. For local installations, follow these steps:
Create a dummy dynamic domain based on your site domain. For example, if your SERVER_AND_PORT property is local.example.com:8080, set DYNAMIC_SERVER_AND_PORT to local.example-dynamic.com:8080.
Add local.example-dynamic.com to /etc/hosts (or C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts) and map it to your local IP address.

Register your developer instance
All component plug-ins must be reviewed and approved before they can be deployed and used by Appian developers to build applications. In order to deploy and test components that are still under-development you must register your developer instance using these steps:

Request a developer token from the AppMarket Submissions Site:
Provide the SERVER_AND_PORT value from custom.properties for your developer instance.
Include details on the type of component(s) you plan to build.
Once your instance is approved we will provide a developer token. The token is valid only for the developer instance identified by the SERVER_AND_PORT you provide in the support case.
Add the following property to your custom.properties file to enable component plug-in development: conf.plugins.INTEGRATION_SDK_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=<token value provided>
