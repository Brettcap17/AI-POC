 The AND Gateway directs all incoming workflow(s) to all of the possible branches. If more than one incoming path is used, all incoming paths must reach the node before the process can continue. It is also used to join all incoming paths.
This node allows you to execute a specific set of tasks in parallel, before moving on to the next stage of your process.
