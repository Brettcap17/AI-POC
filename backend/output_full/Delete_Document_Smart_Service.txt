Configuration options
This section contains tab configuration details specific to this smart service. For more information about common configurations see the Process Node Properties page.
Data tab
The data tab displays the node inputs and outputs for the activity. You can add additional inputs and custom outputs, if needed. The default Document input is listed.
| Input | Data Type | Required | Multiple |
| - | - | - | - |
| Document | Document | Yes | No |
If the activity is run without being assigned to a user (or a group) you must specify values for each of the node inputs listed. You can either manually enter data into the text-field, or a value can be generated using the Expression Editor. When using the Expression Editor, you can reference and modify process variables, rules, constants, and other data. The expressions then specify your Node Input values.
If the node is assigned, the node input values are typed by your assigned user(s) into a form.
a!deleteDocument()
The Delete Document smart service is available as an expression function that can be executed inside a saveInto on a component or as part of a Web API.
