Usage considerations
Where to use this function
The a!customFieldMultiply() function can only be used to create a custom record field that evaluates in real time. This means you can reference related record fields, constants, and other supported functions in your calculations.

Use with other Custom Field functions
You can use the a!customFieldMultiply() function in conjunction with other Custom Field functions, like a!customFieldSubtract(), a!customFieldSum(), or a!customFieldDivide() to create the calculations you need.
See the Real-time evaluation recipes for an example.
Example
Let's say you want to calculate each employee's potential bonus amount. 
The Employee record type has an annualSalary field, which contains each employee's salary amount. The Level record type has a percentBonus field, which determines the potential bonus amount based on an employee's level in the organization.
To calculate each employee's potential bonus amount, you could create a custom record field on the Employee record type that evaluates in real-time so you can reference the related record field from the Level record type in your calculation. 
The expression would look something like this:
sail
a!customFieldMultiply(
  value: {
    recordType!Employee.fields.annualSalary,
    recordType!Employee.relationships.level.fields.percentBonus
  }
)
Supported functions
In addition to record fields, related record fields, and other custom record fields, you can reference any of the following supported functions in the value parameter of a!customFieldMultiply():

appian-style-note
