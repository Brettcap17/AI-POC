Usage considerations
Understanding results
The soundex code is all uppercase. The first character is retained. From the remainder, vowels are dropped.
Repeated letters are made into single letters.
"BFPV" are coded as "1", "CGJKQSXZ"] as "2","DT" as "3", "L" as "4", "MN" as "5", and "R" as "6" and unfilled characters are "0". For example, "Sullivan" and "Suliban" are both "S415". "Smith" and "Smythe" are both "S530".
