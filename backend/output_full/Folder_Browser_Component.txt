Usage considerations
Displaying items and offline use

Each column displays items in alphabetical order.
Avoid using this component for offline mobile forms because tapping on a folder does not display its contents.

Permissions

The current user must have permission to view the selected folder or knowledge center in the parameter.
Within a folder or knowledge center, the user can only see contents for which they have permission to view.

Examples
Copy and paste an example into the INTERFACE DEFINITION in EXPRESSION MODE to see it displayed.
