Usage considerations
Where to use this function
The a!customFieldDateDiff() function can only be used to create a custom record field that evaluates in real time. This means you can reference related record fields, constants, and other supported functions in your calculations.
By default, this function is used in the Date Difference template. You can also use this function when you write your own custom record field expression that evaluates in real-time.

Using the startDate and endDate parameters
By default, the startDate parameter is subtracted from the endDate parameter. This means that if the startDate is 12/1/2022 and the endDate is 12/10/2022, the resulting value would be 9 days. 
You can use the following values in the startDate and endDate parameters:
- Record field or related record fields of type Date or Date and Time. Use the recordType! domain to reference your fields. For example, recordType!Case.fields.submittedDate.
- Relative date and time functions, like today() or now().

> You cannot use a relative date and time function in both parameters.


Constants.

If either parameter is null or empty, a null value is returned.
Example
See the Date Difference template for an example.
Supported functions
In addition to record fields, related record fields, and other custom record fields, you reference any of the following supported functions in the interval parameter of a!customFieldDateDiff(). This allows you to use functions like if() or not() to determine which interval value to return.
