Overview
This page provides guidance on how System administrators can use the different types of log files that Appian produces to assess performance, analyze usage, troubleshoot issues, and audit activity.
Monitoring performance and usage
Performance logs are written to the APPIAN_HOME/logs/perflogs directory.  These logs are written in CSV files for easy observation and analysis using common spreadsheet tools.  The information in them can be used to learn the broad spectrum of what actions take place in the system and how long those actions take to complete.
The log files include one for each Appian engine written to every minute (Engine Performance Logs) and up to three kinds of logs for various events written by the application server which include the following:

Summary: Enabled by default. Written to once every five minutes and aggregate all the relevant events since the last line was logged into one set of metrics.  One line is written per update, even if there were no events in the given interval.
Details: Enabled by default. Written to once every hour, and while they have similar information to the summary logs, they provide fine-grain aggregation by type of event.  Multiple lines are written per update, but if no events occurred in the given interval then nothing is written.
Trace: Disabled by default. When enabled, updates every time an event occurs with in-depth information about the event in question. Trace logs are disabled by default because they require a greater and less predictable amount of disk space and they contain potentially sensitive human-entered data such as usernames.

Some events have certain phases of their execution separately timed.  These "phase times" are parts of the total time, but the total time is not necessarily covered completely by the phase times.  Even if an event has measured phases, it may not record a time for that phase.  Logs that contain phases have individual counts for each phase to show how many of the total recorded events actually participated.

appian-style-note
Do not open the .csv files of a running system directly in programs that lock files for editing. In doing so, the application server and/or engines may no longer be able to write to them until they are restarted.  Copy the files, then open only the copies. To easily copy the standard selection of log files Appian Technical Support has found useful for debugging purposes into a single archive, see the log collection script.

Data store performance logs
These logs record the operations of querying data in a data store using query rules, writing data via the Write to Data Store Entity Smart Service, and verifying current information in the data store.  These three types of data store operations (Query, Write, Verify) can include the following three phases:

Prepare: Formatting the RDBMS call.
Execute: Waiting to hear back from the RDBMS.
Transform: Processing the results received from the RDBMS.

Not all operations involve all three phases. For example, Verify operations do not go through a Transform phase.
In order to aid the identification of slow operations, a separate log file with the same columns records a duplicate entry of only those operations that take more than three seconds to complete. If three seconds is not an appropriate threshold for what qualifies as a slow query, it can be adjusted using the property conf.monitoring.rdbms.SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD_MS in custom.properties, which takes an integer value in milliseconds.

Summary File and Details File Metrics (data_store_summary.csv / data_store_details.csv)

appian-style-tip
Metrics labeled "[Details Only]" apply only to the details file. This is because the details file provides the same metrics as the summary file, but the metrics are broken down for each data store, entity, and query rule.

Data Service Trace Log
The data service provides a trace log that captures information about the requests made by application server to the data service.
Trace File Metrics (ads_call_trace.csv)

appian-style-note
Because some operations may execute many calls to the data service, enabling the data service call trace log may adversely affect system performance.

| Metric                | Description                                                       |

Engine Summary Log
This file contains information about the status of each engine server. It is written every five minutes to engine_summary.csv, but unlike other summary logs, one line is written for each configured engine. If there is more than one server hosting Appian engines, the log is written only on the server configured first in appian-topology.xml.
Metrics include the following:
| Metric             | Description                                                                          |

Process Execution Logs
These files contain information about the performance of processes on the Appian engines. The data is measured and written in batches, every 5 minutes, to files named according to the convention top_models_by_time_<ENGINE-ACRONYM>_<TIMESTAMP>.csv and top_processes_by_time_<ENGINE-ACRONYM>_<TIMESTAMP>.csv, where the engine acronyms follow the same convention as the engine performance logs above. These logs can provide additional insight into process resource usage and are best used in conjunction with the perf_monitor_db logs.
For example, you can use the perf_monitor_db log to determine when there may be a timeframe that the CPU idle time % dips to an undesirable level. Both the top_models_by_time and top_processes_by_time logs can then be used to determine which processes or models consumed the most resources during this same timeframe. The models or processes with high "Percent of Interval (%)" values in this specific measured interval are the most resource intensive processes, indicating potential room for design adjustments.

Expressions Performance Logs
These log files provide performance measurements on the building blocks of Appian expressions: functions and rules.
Rules can contain both functions and/or other rules.  In such cases, the measured time of the main rule will include that of any nested rules and/or functions.
The trace and summary logs measure the usage of Appian functions, rules, and custom plug-in functions together to make it easier to debug issues or check the health of your overall system. However, Appian functions are measured in a separate details log from rules and custom plug-in functions to make it easier to distinguish between the usage of your objects and Appian functions.

appian-style-tip
If a function or rule does not evaluate successfully it will not be measured.  Under certain additional circumstances both rules and Appian-provided functions may go unmeasured.  Custom Function Plug-ins that evaluate successfully are always measured.

Trace File Metrics (expressions_trace.csv)

appian-style-note
Because most interfaces evaluate many rules and expression functions to serve a single request, enabling the expressions trace log may adversely affect system performance.

Slow Plug-in Function Metrics (plugin_functions_slow.csv)
This log displays all plug-in functions that take longer than 5 seconds to complete or have a result size over 100,000 AMUs. Plug-in functions that show up in this log should be investigated to determine if the performance is expected or can be improved. Long running plug-in functions can correlate with high memory usage which causes a site's overall performance to degrade.
| Metric                      | Description                                                                   |

| Result Size                 | Size of the value returned by the plug-in function measured in AMUs. Large result sizes can have an impact on memory usage and should be investigated to determine if such a large result is expected or needed. However, a plug-in can still use a large amount of memory even if the result size is small. For example, a plug-in function that searches all document folders for a single file can use a lot of memory even if the result size is small. |

REST API Performance Logs
These logs report information on Appian's REST API, which powers both Appian's web interface as well as the mobile clients.
Requests are broken into five phases:

Prepare - Time spent preparing to make a data source lookup. This phase may also involve secondary lookups.
Query - Time spent querying the main data source involved in processing the REST API call in question.
Render - Time spent post-processing the returned data and preparing it to display.
Task Fetch - Time spent retrieving task information related to the REST API call results.
User Fetch - Time spent pulling information about users related to the REST API call results.

Report Performance Logs
These files provide performance measurements on reporting functionality executed through the Designer Interface.  They can include the following three phases:

Query - Waiting to hear back from the RDBMS.
Group - Organizing the results by columns.
Sort - Applying the sort configurations.
Merge - Combining the results from each Appian Engine into a single result.

Not all operations involve all three phases. For example, Verify operations do not go through a Transform phase.

Search Server Replication Performance Logs
The search server replication performance log records the replication of data to the search server for indexing. The log is written to each time a replication occurs, which can be up to once per minute.
Summary File Metrics (search_server_replication_summary.csv)


Metric
Description


Timestamp
Date and time of the replication.


Server Id
Unique identifier for the application server that is the source of the replication activity. This can be used to filter or group replication entries.


ID
Unique identifier for the replication event. Multiple lines may all be part of the same replication event.


Source
Source of the data being replicated to the search server.


Sink
The destination index in the search server to which the data is being replicated.


Action
The type of replication action that occurred. Possible values are
      
BULK_LOAD - Replication of all relevant data from the source.
INCREMENTAL_UPDATE - Incremental update of recent changes to data in the source. Each change is referred to as a transaction.




Total Time (ms)
Total amount of time spent replicating the data. This value will be greater than the sum of the other timing values in this log because it contains the time for overhead and phases not specifically logged.


Txn Count
Number of transactions replicated as part of an INCREMENTAL_UPDATE action. When the action is BULK_LOAD, this value is reported as -1, indicating there are no transactions to replicate.


Delete Count
Number of items deleted from the index as part of the INCREMENTAL_UPDATE action. When the action is BULK_LOAD, this value is reported as -1, indicating that the index is cleared in its entirety instead of deleting individual items.


Delete Time (ms)
Amount of time spent deleting items from the index.


Load Count
Number of items loaded from the source for replication.


Load Time (ms)
Amount of time spent loading items from the source for replication.


Upsert Count
Number of items updated or inserted into the destination index. This value will sometimes be less than the Load Count value because certain types of objects are excluded from replication.


Upsert Prepare Time (ms)
Amount of time spent preparing the items for updating or inserting into the destination index.


Upsert Persist Time (ms)
Amount of time spent updating or inserting items into the destination index.


Smart Services Performance Logs
These logs only report the performance of Java Smart Services, including both Appian and plug-in Smart Services. They do not cover other types of nodes such as gateways, tasks, and script nodes.

Stored Procedure Execution Logs
These logs contain information about calls made to execute stored procedures in the database using the following smart service and functions:
- Execute Stored Procedure smart service
- executeStoredProcedureForQuery function
- executeStoredProcdureOnSave function
Trace File Metrics (stored_procedures_trace.csv/stored_procedures_slow.csv)
The stored_procedures_trace.csv file captures information about every call made to execute stored procedures. 
The stored_procedures_slow.csv has the same columns but only records the calls that take more than 15 seconds to execute. Use this to identify slower executions of stored procedures.
You can change the 15 second threshold for this log using the conf.executeStoredProcedure.SLOW_PROCEDURE_THRESHOLD_MS property in custom.properties file. It takes an integer value in milliseconds.

Search Server Metrics Log
The Search Server Metrics log file (search_server.csv) provides information on the search server component of the Appian architecture. This information is written by an agent within the application server, so in a multiple application server environment this log will be written on each application server running rather than the machine(s) running the search server (if separate).
If there is an error when connecting to the search server to gather the metrics, the values in the numeric columns will be -1 and the text-based columns will have an error message or be blank.
All of the total Count and Time columns are calculated since the last startup of the search server. Restarting the application server running the search server will cause these values to reset to 0 in the next write to the log.
The full set of metrics are as follows:
| Metric                              | Description                                                                                                                  |

Search Server Cluster Metrics Log
The Search Server Cluster Metrics log file (search_server_cluster.csv) provides information on the overall health of the search server cluster and the number of nodes and shards in the cluster. The information is written to the file even in environments where there is only a single search server node. In that case it is a cluster of one node. This information is written by an agent within the application server, so in a multiple application server environment this log will be written on each application server rather than the machine(s) running the search server (if separate).
If there is an error when connecting to the search server to gather the metrics, the values in the numeric columns will be -1 and the text-based columns will have an error message or be blank.


Metric
Description


Timestamp
Date and time when the metric is taken.


Cluster Name
Name of the search server cluster. The default cluster name is appian-search-cluster.


Status
Overall health status of the cluster. An error statement is printed to the status column if an error occurs while attempting to query the cluster health.
         
GREEN - All of the configured nodes are up and running and all shards are allocated to those nodes. The search server can accept reads and writes.
YELLOW - Some shards are not allocated to nodes, most likely because one or more of the configured nodes are unavailable. The search server can accept reads and writes.
RED - The search server cluster no longer has a master node because fewer than half plus one of the configured nodes are available. The search server will continue to serve read requests, but will not be able to accept writes.




Timed Out
Whether or not the attempt to query the cluster health timed out. Possible value: true or false


Number of Nodes
Total number of nodes currently running in the cluster.


Number of Data Nodes
Number of nodes currently running in the cluster that can accept data, either as writes from the Appian EAR or as replicated data from other nodes.


Active Primary Shards
Number of shards that are active and accept writes from the Appian EAR.


Active Shards
Total number of shards that are active, including both primary and replica shards. This number is the number of active shards times the number of nodes in the cluster.


Relocating Shards
Number of shards that are in the process of moving from one node to another. It is important not to make changes to the search cluster while this number is non-zero.


Initializing Shards
Number of shards that are currently being initialized. This occurs when the indices are first created either at system startup or on first usage.


Unassigned Shards
Number of shards that are currently not assigned to any nodes. This number will be non-zero when one or more of the configured nodes is unavailable.

Troubleshooting
Log files are an important tool for troubleshooting system problems.  Because logs are assumed to be only accessible by system administrators, information about problems arising from individual process models is made available through the interface and sent via notifications to the process designer.  Information is written to logs about issues that affect the entire system, including those arising from the content of configuration files, availability of connections to other services, ability to interact with file system resources, and unexpected runtime errors.
Design Error Log
Expression errors in start forms, task forms, Tempo reports, record lists, record views, related actions, and Web APIs are written to a comma separated value (CSV) file (design_errors.csv) in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs directory. This log has the following columns:
| Metric        | Description                                     |
| ---               | ---                                                 |
| Timestamp     | Date and time when an error occurred.               |
| Username      | The username of the user who experienced the error. |
| Design Object Name | The name of the design object where the error occurred. Process model names are given in the en_US locale if available, otherwise the first is used.                                 |
| Design Object Type | The type of the design object where the error occurred. Possible values: Start Form, Record Lists, Record View, Related Action, Report, Task Form, Web API.                                        |
| Application Name   | The name of the application containing the design object, or N/A if it is not in an application. If the object is in multiple applications, the names in a semicolon-delimited list. |
| Error Code    | The Appian error code for the error.                |
| Error Message | A message describing the error that occurred.       |
| Evaluation ID | A unique identifier for the expression evaluation the error occurred in. The same ID will be displayed in the error message, so you can use it to find the corresponding log entry. |
| Object UUID | The UUID of the design object the error occurred in. You can search for objects by UUID in Appian Designer. |
| Record Instance ID | For errors that occur on record views, the identifier of the record the error occurred in. |
| Record View URL Stub | For errors that occur on record views, the URL stub of the view the error occurred in. |
| Environment | The environment where the error occurred. Possible values: "TEMPO", "SITES", and "EMBEDDED". |
| Site UUID | For Site errors only, the Site UUID where the error occurred. If the error occurred in Tempo or Embedded, this column is null. |
| Site Name | For Site errors only, the name of the Site where the error occurred. If the error occurred in Tempo or Embedded, this column is null. |
| Site Page Web Address Identifier | For Site errors only, the web address identifier for the Site where the error occurred. If the error occurred in Tempo or Embedded, this column is null. |
| Site Application Name | For Site errors only, the name of the application that contains the Site where the error occurred. If the Site exists in multiple applications, the application names are displayed in a semicolon-delimited list. If the Site exists outside of an application, the value "N/A" is logged. If the error occurred in Tempo or Embedded, this column is null. |
Health Check Log
Logs for Health Check are located in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs directory. Health Check must be set up and configured on your environment in order for logging to take place.
The health-check.log file records details about Health Check runs and lists errors.
The <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/health-check directory contains files generated by the most recent Health Check run. These files can only be viewed by system administrators.
HTTP Request/Response Logs
The HTTP request/response logs for integrations (integration_req_resp_activity.log) capture the raw HTTP request and response messages for integrations. These logs can be used for troubleshooting. They're located in the APPIAN_HOME/logs/perflogs/http-requests-and-responses/ subdirectory, which can only be accessed by system administrators.
Integration calls are only logged when they have been enabled in both the Admin Console and the individual integration objects. Developers can only turn on logging for integrations that use an HTTP or OpenAPI connected system.

appian-style-note
The HTTP request/response logs may contain sensitive data or credentials. Before enabling HTTP request/response logs for integrations, it's important to understand the integration logging guidelines.

To view information about log rotation and retention, see the Managing Log Files section below.
Deployment Log
Logs for direct deployment are located in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs directory. The deployment.log file records details about incoming and outgoing deployments from the environment. Deployment between environments in your infrastructure must be set up and enabled in order for logging to take place.
Application Server
When the application server encounters an unexpected error, a message describing the error is logged to tomcat-stdOut.log in <APPIAN_HOME>/logs.  Issues encountered during startup are written either to a separate file managed by the application server itself or to standard output.
You can refer to these files to acquire a specific error message and use it in a help ticket, News feed post, or documentation search as part of your troubleshooting.
For example, you may see the following error and report it:
[default-threads - 29] ERROR com.appiancorp.ra.workpoller.WorkPoller - Could not obtain 3 thread(s) after 10000 attempts

The error means an unattended node, possibly one running a Custom Smart Service Plug-In, is taking an abnormally long time to complete.
Plug-in Functions Running During High System Memory
When the application server enters a state of high memory usage (i.e. memory used is greater than 75%), an entry is logged to plugin_functions_running_during_high_system_memory.csv for each plug-in function running at that time. The goal of this log is to help identify why the application server's memory usage is so high. Plug-in functions are often the culprits of memory spikes, and therefore all of the plug-in functions running while the application server is in a state of high memory usage warrant investigation. Pay special attention to those plug-ins with the longest elapsed time since plug-ins functions with long evaluation times tend to use more memory as well.
| Metric                      | Description                                                                   |

| Evaluation Type             | The type of object that contains the plug-in function. Possible values: record list, record view, report, start form, task form, related action (process start), related action (quick task), process node, web API, internal, interface designer. |
| Object UUID                 | The UUID of the design object where the plug-in was evaluated. You can search for objects by UUID in Appian Designer. |
| Record Instance ID          | For evaluation types of record view, the record identifier (rv!identifier).      |
| Record View URL Stub        | For evaluation types of record view, the record view URL stub.                    |

| Elapsed Time (ms)             | Total time spent evaluating the plug-in function from its start until the log entry occurred. This is not the plug-in function's entire evaluation time. |
Data Service
Logs for the data service are located in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/data-server/ directory. The watchdog.log file contains information about data service startup and shutdown, configuration values being used by the data service, and entries for general data service operations and errors. The other logs in the directory contain log entries specific to the various subcomponents of the data service.
The logs in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/data-server directory do not contain any proprietary or sensitive data. In the event that sensitive data might be required to troubleshoot an issue with the data service, the data-server-client-errors-detail.log file in the <APPIAN_HOME/logs> directory will contain this information.
Search Server
By default, logs for the search server are located in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/search-server/ directory. This can be controlled by editing <APPIAN_HOME>/search-server/conf/log4j.properties.
Service Manager
Service Manager, the process that coordinates the Appian Engines, records information about engine startup and shutdown, checkpointing, and transaction replication in /logs/service_manager.log.
Engine Databases
Database communication events and errors are logged in text files within the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/ directory.
Each database event and error log filename is constructed in the following syntax:
db_EngineAcronym_DATE_TIME.log

Examples:
db_CO1_2011-07-22_2020.log
db_PD1_2011-07-22_1917.log

Each database event and error log is written in the following syntax:
DATE TIMESTAMP [Engine Acronym] {Engine File} LOGGING LEVEL Message Type "User Context" "Timing in milliseconds" "Action"

Examples:
2011-07-22 20:20:18 [PA00011] {pa2.kdb 13} (Default) WARN .a.pf.te "Administrator" "251.0251" ".a.p.TOPICS.send_message"
2011-07-22 20:20:17 [PX001] {pe2.kdb 1} (Default) WARN .a.p.PROCESS.i "Incremental Update: Exec Engine is not ready to start Incremental update."

Message Types include the following:

te = transaction execution
tg = table growth

By default, the logging level for all is set to INFO.
For diagnostic reasons, you may want to temporarily increase the amount of information that is logged. You can change this setting by creating a new log_XX_YY.properties file that configures logging for an individual gateway.
The logging property file names that can be used to customize logging for an individual application engine database include the following:
| Server ID               | Custom Server Logging File |
| ---                         | ---                            |

| NO Notifications Service    | log_db_NO.properties   |
| PE Personalization          | log_db_PE.properties   |
| PO Portal                   | log_db_PO.properties   |
| DF Discussion Forums        | log_db_DF.properties   |
| PA Process-Analytics        | log_db_PA.properties   |
| PX Process-Execution (All)  | log_db_PX.properties   |
| PD Process-Design           | log_db_PD.properties   |
Engine Event Logs
The Appian engines produce .l files whenever they encounter certain types of unexpected events. These .l files contain diagnostic information about the event as well as the transaction that initiated it.  The names of the .l files are all of the form <engine identifier>_<timestamp>_<event type>.l. Use the <APPIAN_HOME>/server/_scripts/diagnostic/convert_l_to_text.sh (.bat) script to convert these logs to text for review.

Data Type Locks
The log for information regarding locks on data types (data-type-locks.log) is located in <APPIAN_HOME>/logs directory. The log shows all the calls to lock and unlock data types, at the INFO level, when a data type is updated by various mechanisms like application import, XSD import, etc. The log can help resolve issues regarding data types being locked when attempting to update them or their precedents.
MariaDB Upgrade Check Logs

appian-style-note
These logs are only applicable for Appian Cloud customers.

The logs regarding potential compatibility issues for upgrade to MariaDB as the Appian Cloud database are captured in <APPIAN_HOME>/logs. There are three corresponding logs:

The Database Incompatibility Check Log (mariadb-incompatibility-report.log) captures compatibility issues within scripts in the Cloud database.
Query Database Smart Service Incompatibility Check Log (query_node_mariadb_incompatibility.log) captures compatibility issues in the Query Database Smart Service.
MariaDB Column Type Conversion Log (mariadb-column-type-conversions.log) captures the database columns that changed their type after Appian Cloud database is upgraded from MySQL to MariaDB.

Blocked Files
When a file upload is blocked by the virus scanner (Cloud only) or by file extension, information is logged in a comma-separated (CSV) file, blocked_files.csv, in <AE_HOME>/logs/audit/. Data captured include the following:


Column
Description


Timestamp
Date and time when the request was made in yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format.


User
The username of the user who uploaded the file.


Document Name
The name of the uploaded file, including the extension.


Reason
The reason why the file was blocked. Options: "Virus Detected", "File Extension", "File Type"


Details

     The details depend on the reason the file was blocked:
     
If the reason is "Virus Detected", the name of the virus signature that blocked the file from being uploaded.
If the reason is "File Extension", the extension of the file.
If the reason is "File Type", additional details on the underlying type and expected extension versus the found extension




Hash
The hash of the file that was blocked. This column provides insight into whether a single file or multiple file are being blocked. The "Document Name" column is not sufficient in identifying whether a file is being blocked multiple times since file names can be changed easily.


Cloud Database Requests

appian-style-tip
Cloud database audit logs are only available for Appian Cloud customers. Additionally, these logs are disabled if database encryption feature is enabled on your Appian Cloud site.

Requests sent to the business data source in the Appian Cloud relational database are captured in the rdbms-audit.log.yyyy-MM-dd file, located in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/audit/rdbms directory. The log only contains requests that were sent from Appian, the Cloud Database administrative interface (phpMyAdmin), or the Enhanced Data Pipeline. For data security compliance reasons, this log is only accessible to members of the Database Administrators group.
The following data is captured in this log:
[timestamp][syslog_host][syslog_ident]:[syslog_info][serverhost],[username],[host],[connectionid],[queryid],[operation],[database],[object],[retcode]

Deletions
Object and plug-in deletions are recorded in a comma-separated value (CSV) file, deletion.log, in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs directory. If an object or plug-in is deleted and you need to know when it was deleted and which user did it, you can refer to this log file.
The following object deletions are recorded:

Connected System
Constant
Data Store
Data Type
Document
Document Folder
Expression Rule
Feed
Group
Group Type
Integration
Interface
Process Model
Process Model Folder
Record Type
Rule Folder
Site
Tempo Feed Entry
Tempo Report
Web API

Deleting an object version is also recorded for objects that support versioning.
Note that for document files, only deletions (which are not reversible) are logged. Deactivations (which are reversible) are not logged because the files still exist in the system even though they do not appear in the interface.

Forgot Password Requests
User requests to reset a forgotten password are logged in a comma-separated (CSV) file, forgot_password_requests.csv, in <AE_HOME>/logs/audit/. Data captured includes the following:


Column
Description


Timestamp
Date and time when the request was made in yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format.


Username
The username entered in the reset request.


Email Address
The email address to which the email was sent. If no email was sent, this field will be blank.


Email Type
The type of email sent. Valid values are: "Password Reset," "Deactivated User," "Password Not Old Enough," and "Not Authenticated Through Appian." The value may also be blank if an email was not sent. In such a case, "Reason Email Was Not Sent" will have a value explaining why an email was not sent.


Requestor IP Address
The IP address that the application server associated with this request.


Reason Email Was Not Sent

The value will be empty if email was sent. Otherwise, value will be one of the following:

User does not exist.
User does not have an email address
User email address is invalid

Invalid "from address" in custom.properties





Logins
Each log in attempt is recorded in the login-audit.csv file. This file is located in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs directory.
The following login events are recorded:

Internal authentication through the login page.
Single Sign On and/or an external directory service.
Successfully authenticated web API call.

Data captured includes the following:



Column
Description


Login Timestamp
Date and time when a login or access attempt occurs. yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
(Milliseconds are excluded.)


User
The username submitted by the login attempt.


Status
The login attempt status is recorded as Succeeded, Failed, or Transient (Appian Mobile Application logins only) .


IP
The IP address that the application server associated with this request.


Source
One of the following authentication sources is listed: 
        Portal (includes LDAP and SAML authentication)
Email
JMS Message
SharePoint
Web Service
Web API (if HTTP basic authentication logging is enabled)



User Agent
The self-reported client information (such as browser version) for web browsers. Mobile clients list the following details. Agent name, such as AppianiOS or AppianBB Appian Mobile application version number Device name, such as iPad, iPhone, or 9780Device Device OS version, such as 4.2.1 (iOS) or 6.0.0.359 (BB OS)  Internal build number 


Transaction ID
A unique identifier (UUID) for each login attempt. Can be utilized to group Appian Mobile application logins, for which both a "Transient" and "Succeeded" entry can be recorded.


Session UUID
The Appian user's unique identifier (UUID) for the session that was logged in. Also found in `logout-audit.csv`


A login is determined to have Succeeded when the following valid credentials are passed:

The username and password combination is correct.
The user is not deactivated.
The user is not locked.
The user has not reached the maximum allowed number of concurrent sessions.
(Appian Cloud only) If the Trusted IP Address feature is enabled, the login must also meet the established IP address or origination domain criteria.
The user's password is expired, but the user is prompted to change their password before proceeding.
It is possible for a user to repeatedly attempt to login and cancel the password change.
Each such attempt is logged as a success.
When Single Sign On is enabled, a successful login occurs when the user accesses Appian (according to each window opened during the session).
For example, should the user close the browser, then reopen it a few minutes later before the Appian session expired, another success is recorded.

Logins via the Appian Mobile application are handled via an in-app browser. For these logins, a Transient entry is recorded when the user identity has been validated in the in-app browser, but a session has not yet been created. When a valid session is established, a Succeeded entry is added. All successful mobile logins will be preceded by a Transient entry. If you are looking to count successful logins, ignore Transient entries and only count Succeeded entries.
The user agent information reported by the web browser often includes industry acronyms and jargon with unclear meaning.
For example:

Mozilla/4.0 may be reported by any browser that is compatible with Firefox.
Windows NT 6.1 is reported by browsers that are using Windows 7.

Special Consideration for Cloud
To view the login-audit file, access the navigation menu in Appian and select System Logs.
Logouts
User session logouts are recorded in the logout-audit.csv file. This file is located in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs directory.
The following logout events are recorded:

A user session has expired.
A user manually logs themselves out.
A user is renamed, logging out all active sessions.
A user is deactivated, logging out all active sessions.
A maintenance window is triggered, logging out relevant user sessions.

Data captured includes the following:



Column
Description


Login Timestamp
Date and time when the login occurred and session was created. yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss


Last Activity Time
Date and time for the last session activity. yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss


Session Deletion Time
Date and time when the user was logged out and the session deleted. yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss 


User Active Duration (HH:mm:ss)
Amount of time from login to "Last Activity Time".


Session Duration (HH:mm:ss)
Amount of time from login to logout.


User
The username for the user session.


Logout Reason
One of the following values:
        SESSION_EXPIRATION
LOGOUT
USER_RENAME
USER_DEACTIVATION
MAINTENANCE_WINDOWS



User UUID
The Appian user's unique identifier (UUID).


Session UUID
The Appian user's unique identifier (UUID) for the session that was logged out. Also found in `login-audit.csv`.



If the node hosting the web application server or the web application server itself is shutdown unexpectedly, any active user sessions will not be recorded in the logout audit at this time. 

Session audits can easily be accomplished by joining login-audit and logout-audit data with Session UUID.

When processes are deleted or archived, these events are recorded in a comma-separated (CSV) log file in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/audit/ directory. Each log file is named according to the convention removed_processes_db_PX<ENGINE_NUMBER>_<TIMESTAMP>.csv. Only the primary engines will write to this log.
Example Log File Name:
shell
removed_processes_db_PX001_2019-08-19_1436.csv
Data captured in the log include the following:
| Column                           | Description             |

User Deactivations
User accounts that are deactivated due to inactivity are listed at the INFO level in db_PE_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm.log in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/ directory.
The following message appears in the logs before a comma-separated list of usernames.
These user accounts were deactivated automatically due to inactivity: [<usernames>]
User Management
Activity related to user management is recorded in the log file <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/audit/user_management.csv. This is a comma-separated value (CSV) file with the following columns:
| Metric               | Description       |
| ---                      | ---                   |

| Modified By Username | The username of the user who performed the action.   |
The first line of the log prints out the log initialization timestamp. The following actions have specific behavior:

Change User Status - This action distinguishes between when a user is deactivated manually (in the Users view or via smart service) and when a user is deactivated due to inactivity. The logged values are Inactive (manual) and Inactive (idle user).
Change Lock Status - This action is logged when an account is locked because of too many failed login attempts and when it is manually unlocked by a system administrator. The action does not log when an account is automatically unlocked based on the lock expiring.
Change Password - This action is logged when the user changes their own password, someone clicks the Forgot Password link, or an administrator resets a password. See the forgot password requests log and password resets log for more details on those specific types of password changes.

Unscanned Files
When the scan of an uploaded file is skipped by the virus scanner (Cloud only), information is logged in a comma-separated (CSV) file, unscanned_files.csv, in <AE_HOME>/logs/audit/. Data captured include the following:


Column
Description


Timestamp
Date and time when the file was uploaded in yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format.


User
The user who uploaded the file.


Document ID
The content ID of the uploaded file.


Reason
The reason that the file went unscanned. Possible values: "File too large", "Timeout", "Scanner unreachable", and "Other."


Managing Log Files
Log files can accumulate rapidly and must be actively managed.
Log Rotation
The Tomcat log file is rotated daily:

By default on Windows
Only if rotatelogs is enabled and is on the PATH on Linux

The latest log file will is named tomcat-stdOut.log. Logs for prior days will have a date suffix with the format tomcat-stdOut.log.yyyy-MM-dd.
Appian log files are rotated to limit the total size of logs.
login-audit.csv is rotated daily. All other logs are rotated when they reach a size limit. When this occurs, the system will create a new file of the same name to continue logging, and rename the old file with a numerical suffix. For example: file_downloads.log will become file_downloads.log.1.
The rdbms-audit.log.yyyy-MM-dd log rotates every 10MB and is compressed after every 500 rotations. A new log is written starting at midnight each day, and any uncompressed log files from the previous day are compressed at 2:00am. This is only applicable to Cloud customers.
The integration_req_resp_activity.log log is rotated daily. It will also be rotated whenever the file size for a single log exceeds 10MB. When the log file rotates, it is given a new name using the Unix time: integration_req_resp_activity.{unix}.log. Each log file will be deleted after 1,000 rotations or 7 days, whichever comes first.

appian-style-note
Never configure HTTP integration request/response logging using the appian_log4j.properties files. Making any change to the log4j.appender.INTEGRATION_REQ_RESP_ALL properties will lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, they should be configured in the Admin Console.

Limiting Log File Size
The maximum size for any log file is determined by the following property in the appian_log4j.properties files:
log4j.appender.<APPENDER_NAME>.MaxFileSize=
Modify this property to increase or decrease the maximum size of the file.
This is set to 10MB by default.
Log Retention
Logs continue to rotate until the maximum number of log files for that log is reached. Once the maximum is reached, the oldest will be deleted when a new log of the same name is created on the next rotation.
Log Retention for Appian Cloud
Log retention is different for Appian Cloud. Only the latest two (2) log files for each log are retained, except for the application server log which is periodically compressed as needed, and the Cloud database audit logs which are retained in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/audit/rdbms directory for one week.
Older log files in Appian Cloud are deleted in intervals at the following minute marks of every hour:
2
12
22
32
42
52
Limiting Number of Log Files
The number of files that are created is limited by the following property in the appian_log4j.properties file:
log4j.appender.<APPENDER_NAME>.MaxBackupIndex=
Modify this property to define the maximum number of log files to keep.
By default, most logs retain a maximum of 10 old versions, but some retain 100 or 1,000. You can find the default value for each log listed in appian_log4j.properties.
Removing Log Files
In order to prevent log files from consuming excessive disk space, you must periodically run the cleanup.bat (.sh) script to move or delete older log files. You can find the script here:
<APPIAN_HOME>/server/_scripts
To remove aging log files, use the logs argument, passing the path to a backup folder and the number of log files to keep.
For example:
./cleanup.sh logs -target /appian_backup_log_files/ -keep 3
This command moves all but the three most-recent log files to the/appian_backup_log_files/ directory.

Securing Log Files
Log files, particularly troubleshooting and audit files, can include usernames, content ids, and other information that may be considered sensitive.  Accordingly <APPIAN_HOME>/logs directory, its subdirectories, and the files within it should be secured so that only trusted administrators can access them.
Directions for doing so can be found in your operating system's documentation.
Modifying Log Output
Adding HTML Filter Log Messages
Certain HTML tags and tag attributes are forbidden as inputs and are filtered out at runtime. When a forbidden input is encountered, a message similar to the following is logged:
com.appiancorp.security.util.StringSecurityUtils - The HTML tag contained an attribute that we could not process. The request attribute has been filtered out, but the tag is still in place. The value of the attribute was ...

These messages are logged when the following logger in appian_log4j.properties is set to the WARN level. By default, it is set to ERROR.
log4j.logger.com.appiancorp.security.util.StringSecurityUtils=ERROR

See also: HTML Tags and Attributes in Expressions
Adding Unauthorized Session Request Logging
Access attempts made by sessions that do not present appropriate session credentials return HTTP: 401 (Unauthorized) errors to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
By default, this is not logged when it occurs, but messages are sent to the log on rejection when the following line is added to appian_log4j.properties setting the Appian CSRF package to WARN level:
log4j.logger.com.appiancorp.security.csrf=WARN

Adding Database Integration Details
To log the details of the various services that read or write to the database (such as Write to Data Store Smart Service, Query Rules, a!queryEntity(), etc.) add the following loggers:


Output SQL statements:
log4j.logger.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG


Output param values within SQL statements:
log4j.logger.org.hibernate.type=TRACE


To view the calls made by the Query Database Node, add the following logger:
log4j.logger.com.appiancorp.process.runtime.activities.QueryRdbmsActivity=DEBUG`

Lowering Log Messages
You can specify the different logging levels for each component listed below:
| Logging Level | Description                                                                         |
| ---               | ---                                                                                     |
| DEBUG             | This level lists all informational events that occur within the package being logged.   |
| INFO              | This level lists informational messages that highlight the progress of the application. |
| WARN              | This level lists potentially harmful situations.                                        |
| ERROR             | This level lists all error messages that occur when the application is running.         |
| FATAL             | This level lists severe events that could cause the application to abort.               |
When a logger is configured to output log entries at a certain level, it also writes any log entries of greater importance, as defined above.
For example, if it is set to WARN, the logger also outputs ERROR and FATAL log entries. If it is set to DEBUG, the logger writes all entries.
As a best practice, raise the logging level to INFO or WARN during development, and lower it to ERROR in production.

appian-style-note
Increased logging negatively impacts system performance.

In a production system excessive logging may also result in a loss of performance and therefore it may be necessary to remove or lower certain log messages from being written to disk.
You can modify log levels by following the instructions in Customizing Application Logging.
Changing the Logging Directory or Filename
The directory where log files are written is controlled by the following property, in the custom.properties file.
conf.suite.AE_LOGS=<install_dir>/logs

The log file name and path is determined by the
log4j.appender.<APPENDER_NAME>.File= property in <APPIAN_HOME>/deployment/web.war/WEB-INF/resources/appian_log4j.properties.
For example,

log4j.appender.WORK_POLLER.File is set to write to the
work-poller.log file in the <APPIAN_HOME>/logs/ directory.

You can modify this property to write to a different directory and or filename.
Changing Log Syntax
The pattern of the log message is defined in the following property:
log4j.appender.<APPENDER_NAME>.layout.ConversionPattern=

You can modify this property based on various options defined in the Log4j documentation.
Changing Log Appenders
In the appian_log4j.properties file, appenders are used to define the output formats of the log file messages. The appenders are listed in the root logger, which uses the following convention:
log4j.rootLogger=<LOGGING_LEVEL>, <APPENDER_NAME_1>, <APPENDER_NAME_2>

In the following example, the root logger statement writes ERROR level messages (and above) using two appenders (console for <APPENDER_NAME_1> and a named text file appender for <APPENDER_NAME_2>).
log4j.rootLogger=ERROR, CONSOLE, WORK_POLLER

This sample appender (named the WORK_POLLER appender) writes messages to a text file named work-poller.log.
###### WORK_POLLER appender
log4j.appender.WORK_POLLER.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.WORK_POLLER.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ABSOLUTE} %-5p [%c{1}] %m%n
log4j.appender.WORK_POLLER=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.WORK_POLLER.File=${AE_LOGS}/work-poller.log
log4j.appender.WORK_POLLER.MaxFileSize=10MB
log4j.appender.WORK_POLLER.MaxBackupIndex='''1000'''
