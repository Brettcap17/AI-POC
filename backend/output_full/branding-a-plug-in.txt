This page explains how to brand your plug-in with an image representing your system.
Your branding will be used and seen by the designer in three places:  

When creating a new connected system (shown below)
When creating a new integration from your plug-in
When using an integration from your plug-in in a process model

Using a single image
To add a single logo for a connected system template add the image to the resources/ directory that is parallel to your template's package.
For a template, src/main/java/com/appian/MyConnectedSystemTemplate.java, place the 80 pixel image at src/main/resources/com/appian/MyConnectedSystemTemplate_80px.<ext>. 

Supported file types are .svg, .jpg, .jpeg, and .png.

Using different images for each display location
To add multiple logos designed for the different resolutions, add the images to the resources/ directory that is parallel to your template's package.
For a template, src/main/java/com/appian/MyConnectedSystemTemplate.java, place the images in the folder, src/main/resources/com/appian/. 
Images for this template must follow this naming convention MyConnectedSystemTemplate_<size>px.<ext>.

Supported file types are: .svg, .jpg, .jpeg, and .png
Supported image sizes are: 40, 50, and 80

If you do not provide one of the optional sizes, the _80px image will be downsized to fit as appropriate.
