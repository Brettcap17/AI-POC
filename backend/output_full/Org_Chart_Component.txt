Usage considerations
Permissions and offline use

In the org chart, the user can only see active users that they have permission to view. If the current user does not have permission to view the selected user in the value parameter or the selected user is deactivated, an error will occur.
Avoid using this component for offline mobile forms since tapping on a user will not update the focus of the org chart to the user.

Structure

The org chart structure is based on users' Supervisor field values.
If supervisor or location information is not populated in user profiles, you can request users to update their own profiles in Tempo or use the Update User Profile Smart Service to update user profiles via process.

Displaying location and user cards

Hovering over a user's profile photo or name displays the corresponding user card, which includes additional information about the user and allows the viewer to quickly follow or unfollow the user.
Location (city, state, country) is displayed on the org chart if the user has a value set in their profile.
