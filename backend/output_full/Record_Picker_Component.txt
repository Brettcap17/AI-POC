Usage considerations
Suggestions and permissions

Suggestions are based on the fields used in the record title. However, if you use a service-backed record type without data sync enabled, the search is based on the search property configured in the source expression. 
Only records that the viewing user has permissions to see appear in the suggestions list, as determined by the record-level security or the default filters in the record type.

Selections and placeholders

Any nulls in the array passed to selected records are not displayed. A [Not Available] token is displayed for any invalid identifiers in the selected records array.
The component always saves an array regardless of how many selections have been made.
By default, all selected record tokens include a link to the record unless showRecordLinks is false. Consider setting showRecordLinks to false when selecting reference data from the picker. See Select a record from a record type without a link to the record for an example.
This picker cannot be used to selected records of a rule-backed record type (deprecated).
Whether placeholder text clears on focus or input varies by device and browser. 

Service-backed record types
If you want to use a record picker with a service-backed record type, it should work as expected, without the need to change your record definition. But, in case something is not working as desired, here are a few notes on how the record picker works and how you can tweak your record design to optimize for a record picker.

When a user types text into the picker field, it is equivalent to a user typing text into the search bar of the record list. The difference is that every new letter in the picker is a new call to the web service, whereas in the record list, the user must hit enter before any calls are made. This means increased load on the web service.
Once a record is picked, the component makes one call to the web service for every picked item to get the information displayed in the label. This could be problematic because there is often overhead in web service calls. For that reason, only use the record picker when the number of items you expect users to pick at one time is low.
Filters applied in the component are processed in the same way that default filters and user filters are processed. This means that any new filters in the picker needed to be handled accordingly in your source expression and data retrieval rule.

If this picker does not meet your needs, use a custom picker.

Examples
Record type object references are specific to each environment. If you copy and paste these examples into an interface, they will not evaluate. Use them as a references only.
