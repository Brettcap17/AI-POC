Usage considerations
Icons and tooltips

Record action items use the icon configured in the record type.
Both the label and description for an action will appear as a tooltip.

Displaying record actions
When you configure a record action, follow the guidance below to ensure the record action displays in the component where it is referenced.

Record action items are displayed based upon record type security, process model security, and the action visibility expression configured in the record type. 
When configuring the recordActions parameter of a read-only grid, use fv!identifier as the identifier to call the selected row ID for a related action. Make sure the grid has values for the Selection parameters properly set up, including the selectable, selectionValue, and selectionSaveInto parameters.
Record action items that reference a related action will not appear when the identifier parameter is null or invalid.

Examples
Copy and paste an example into the INTERFACE DEFINITION in EXPRESSION MODE to see it displayed.
Record type object references are specific to each environment. If you copy and paste these examples into your interface, they will not evaluate. Use them as a references only.
Record action item in the Employee record
sail 
a!recordActionField(
  actions: {
    a!recordActionItem(
    /* For the "action" parameter below, replace the record-action reference 
     * (recordType!Department.actions.create) with a valid record-action reference in your environment.
     */
     action: recordType!Department.actions.create
    ),
    a!recordActionItem(
   /* For the "action" parameter below, replace the record-action reference 
    * (recordType!Department.actions.update) with a valid record-action reference in your environment.
    */
     action: recordType!Department.actions.update,
     identifier: rv!identifier
