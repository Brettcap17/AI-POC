This feature has been deprecated, and will be removed in a future release of Appian. You will no longer be able to attach files to running process instances. Files can be uploaded with the file upload component and managed with Appian's Folder and Document Management system. 
For information about the Add Attachment Smart Service, see the Appian 16.2 documentation.
