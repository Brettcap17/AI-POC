Usage considerations
User, group, and user and group browser components comparison
The user and group browser components create Miller-columns-style browsers that allow users to select a user or group while browsing through a group membership tree.
{:.screenshot}
The three group membership browsing components are:

User Browser
Group Browser
User and Group Browser

Similar to the user and group picker fields, these three components appear the same but differ in what they allow to be selected. Depending on whether users, groups, or users and groups should be selected, choose the group browser, user browser, or user and group browser, respectively. If the interface is only for browsing, use the  group browser, as it is the only browser that can be configured to show only groups and not users.
Saving, selecting, and displaying values

If an initial group is not specified, only the label, tooltip, and instructions will be displayed.
Click a selected user or group to deselect the value. When a user or group is deselected, a null value is saved.
To make the selection required for submission or display validation messages based on the selection, pair the browser with a a picker or other component.

Using the pathValue and pathSaveInto parameters

Because users and groups can appear in multiple places in the browser at one time, a user or group only appears as selected if it is present in the pathValue array.
When a user or group is selected, the variables in selectionSaveInto are updated after the variables in pathSaveInto. This means that if a variable is updated in both saves, it will be updated to the value assigned in the selectionSaveInto when a user or group is selected.
When the component is read-only, the variables in selectionSaveInto are not updated when a user or group is clicked. However, if the selectionValue is set, a user or group can still be displayed as selected. pathSaveInto still updates as normal.
A user or group can only be deselected if present in the pathValue.
The first user or group in the pathValue must be a member of the initial group. Each subsequent user or group in the pathValue must be a member of the group that comes before it in the array. Otherwise, an error will occur.
