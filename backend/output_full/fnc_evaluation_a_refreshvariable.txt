  - keyword: refreshAlways
    types: Boolean
    description: |
      When true, the value of this local variable will be refreshed after each user interaction and each interval refresh. Because the variable is continually refreshed, you cannot update its value by saving into it. Default is false.
  - keyword: refreshInterval
    types: Number (Decimal)
    description: |
      How often the variable value gets refreshed in minutes. When null, the variable will not be refreshed on an interval. Because the variable is periodically refreshed, you cannot update its value by saving into it. Valid values include 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 30, 60.
  - keyword: refreshOnReferencedVarChange
    types: Boolean
    description: |
      When true, the value of this local variable will be refreshed each time the value of any variable it references within the value parameter is updated. To refresh the local variable when another variable that is not used within value changes, use refreshOnVarChange. Default is true.
  - keyword: refreshOnVarChange
    types: Any Type
    description: |
      Refreshes the value of the local variable each time any of these specific variables change. This allows you to refresh the value when a variable that is not referenced within the value parameter is updated.
  - keyword: refreshAfter
    types: List of Text String
    description: |
      Refreshes the value of the local variable after a record action, such as a related action or a record list action configured within a record type, completes from a dialog window within the Record Action Component. Instead of requiring the entire page to reload, this parameter allows you to refresh a local variable value on an interface after a record action completes. Valid values include RECORD_ACTION.
