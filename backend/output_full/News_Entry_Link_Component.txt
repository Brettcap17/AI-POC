Usage considerations
Using and finding the entry ID

To get an entry ID of a post created via smart service, use the Entry Id node output of the Post Event to Feed or the Post System Event to Feed smart services.
To manually get an entry ID from a post while browsing the news feed with a web browser, click on the post's timestamp. The end of the resulting URL in your browser address bar is of the form tempo/news/entry/[entry ID].
