Usage considerations
Where to use this function
The a!customFieldDivide() function can only be used to create a custom record field that evaluates in real time. This means you can reference related record fields, constants, and other supported functions in your calculations.

Use with other Custom Field functions
You can use the a!customFieldDivide() function in conjunction with other Custom Field functions, like a!customFieldSubtract(), a!customFieldSum(), or a!customFieldMultiply() to create the calculations you need.
See the example below to see how you can use the a!customFieldDivide() and a!customFieldSum() functions together.
Example
Let's say you want to calculate the percent of projected revenue to total revenue. The formula to calculate the percent of projected revenue to total revenue is % Projected Revenue to Total Revenue = Projected Revenue / (Current Revenue + Projected Revenue). 
The Customer record type has a currentRevenue field, which displays the current revenue generated by each customer. The Account record type has a projectedRevenue field, which displays the forecasted revenue for each customer account according to the sales department. 
To calculate the percent of projected revenue to total revenue, you could create a new custom record field on the Customer record type that evaluates in real-time so you can reference the related record field from the Account record type in your calculation. 
The expression would look something like this:
sail
a!customFieldDivide(
  numerator: recordType!Customer.relationships.account.fields.projectedRevenue,
  denominator:  a!customFieldSum(
    value: {
        recordType!Customer.fields.currentRevenue,
        recordType!Customer.relationships.account.fields.projectedRevenue
    }
  )
)
Supported functions
In addition to record fields, related record fields, and other custom record fields, you reference any of the following supported functions in either parameter of a!customFieldDivide():
