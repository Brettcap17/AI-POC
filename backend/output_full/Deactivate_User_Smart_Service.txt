Overview
{{ page.excerpt }} Deactivated users are still present in the system, but will not be able to log in. You must be a System Administrator or the Administrator user account in order to perform this task. 

appian-style-caution
The Deactivate User node can only be run with System Administrator rights. Attempting to run this node without sufficient user rights causes a runtime exception that pauses the process and sends an alert to the Process Administrator.

The Administrator user account cannot be deactivated using this smart service.
The Deactivate User node is located under Appian Smart Services > Identity Management in the Process Modeler Palette.
