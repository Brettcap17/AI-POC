Overview
This endpoint retrieves the results of an inspection, given the UUID of the inspection.

HTTP Request Method: GET
Endpoint: /inspections/<uuid>

Request
When performing a GET request, you don’t need a request body. However, you do need to specify the UUID of the inspection you’re querying for. This is done by adding a path parameter to the end of the URL, such as: https://<domain>/suite/deployment-management/v1/inspections/<UUID>
Request example

curl --location --request
