Parameters

Usage considerations
Returns a value of type Boolean.
A false result indicates that the username is available to use when creating a new user, unless the username contains special characters that are not permitted.
Both active and deactivated user accounts are referenced.
The username parameter is case-sensitive, however you will not be able to create a username if case-insensitive matches exist.
isusernametaken() cannot be used to define a column of process report data or in a process event.
