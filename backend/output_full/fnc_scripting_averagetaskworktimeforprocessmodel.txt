Usage considerations
The current user must hold viewer rights or higher authority for the specified process model, in order to execute this function.
If you do not provide a value for the includeSubProcessData parameter, the default value is taken from the current context or set to false if no subprocesses available.
For example, if the function is used on a Web Content with Process Details Channel and the channel's context includes subprocesses, these subprocesses are included by default.
