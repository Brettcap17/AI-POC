Test it out

Type into the first text field, and notice that the second text field is pre-populated. The instructions of the form show the value of the CDT variable.

To write your data to process

Any Type is not a supported data type in the Process Modeler. Before creating the process model, you will need to create a CDT that matches the data structure of local!myCdt.


Save your interface as sailRecipe
Create rule input: myCdt (CDT)
Remove the localVariables() function
Delete local variable: local!myCdt
In your expression, replace:
local!myCdt with ri!myCdt
In your process model, on the process start form or forms tab of an activity, enter the name of your interface in the search box and select it
Click Yes when the Process Modeler asks, "Do you want to import the rule inputs?"
On a task form, change the records node inputs to data type of the CDT used in the interface.
On a start form, change the records process variable to data type of the CDT used in the interface.
