Function
{% include fncsyntax.html %}
{{ page.excerpt }} This component can display thousands of data points without scrolling. 
Users can easily find trends in their data by zooming in to a selected area to see additional details. See Display Date and Time Fields in a Line Chart example below.
When the chart shows date or date and time fields, the x-axis labels are formatted to match the end user's time zone and conveniently resize to avoid clutter.
If specific values are more important than the trend, consider using a column chart.

Configure Charts Using Records

Parameters
{% include parameter_table.html parameters=page.parameters header=page.reftype %}
Configuration
There are two ways to configure a line chart:

Set a record type as the data source and define fields to display on the chart.
Perform your own query and define lists of data within the categories and series.

If you have a record type that uses a database as the source, or a record type with data sync enabled, we recommend using the record type as the source of your chart. This configuration is easier because Appian will perform the query for you and display the results directly in the chart.
If your record type uses a web service as the source and does not have data sync enabled, use the categories and series to construct the chart manually.
Using record data
Configuring a line chart using a record type as the source requires using two parameters: data and config. Once you provide a record type in the data parameter and provide the fields in the config parameter, the chart displays the results.
See Chart Configuration Using Record Data for details on using a record type as the source. See Build Reports from Records for examples of reports created with different charts.
Using categories and series
When using categories and series, you must provide the list of data labels and values directly to these parameters. 
Categories

The order of items in the categories array determines the display order of categories on the chart with the left-most item in the array appearing on the far left of the x-axis.
For each null or empty item in the array passed to categories, [Category #] displays on the x-axis with # as the index number in the categories array of the null or empty item. For example, [Category 1].
The index of each item in the categories array must match with the index of its series data value. 

Series

A single Series item produces a single line with line points for each categories item. Multiple series items produce multiple lines with one line for each series label item displayed in a distinct color and line points for each categories item with a different data marker shape (for example, square, circle, diamond) for each line.
Use a!chartSeries() to create the Chart Series array.
If a series data value is greater than the Max Y-Axis value or less than the Min Y-Axis value, the line continues off the chart, but the line point does not display.
If the series argument has a non-null label value paired with a 0, null, or empty data value, the data value still displays in the legend.
If the series argument has a null or empty label value paired with a non-null data value, the label value displays as [Series #] with # as the index number of the data value. For example, [Series 1].

Usage considerations
Chart data

If data values are small and less than a whole number, Appian recommends settings allowDecimalAxisLabels to true.
If data contains a!recordData or a record type reference, the categories and series parameters are ignored.

Chart line and background color
When the chart is placed in a colored card, the chart background will match the color of the card. Text labels and lines in the chart will also adjust if a dark background color is used. See the SAIL Design System for best practices on using charts with background colors.
Chart refresh behavior

You can define a!refreshVariable parameters directly in the chart without creating additional local variables. The only exception being refreshOnVarChange, which refreshes the chart after a specific local variable has changed.
When you use a record type as the source of your chart, use the refresh parameters in the chart instead of using local variables and the a!refreshVariable() function. This is because the refresh behavior will automatically apply to the fields specified in the data parameter of the chart.
If you're not using a record type as the source of your chart, it's recommended to use local variables and the a!refreshVariable() function to define refresh behavior since you won't use the data parameter to configure your chart.

Examples
Copy and paste an example into the INTERFACE DEFINITION in EXPRESSION MODE to see it displayed.
The examples below demonstrate how to configure your charts using categories and series. For examples on using record data, see Chart Configuration Using Record Data.
