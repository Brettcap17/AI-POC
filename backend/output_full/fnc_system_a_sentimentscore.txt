Usage considerations
Considerations for Appian Cloud users

appian-style-note
Attention Appian Cloud FedRAMP, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS customers:
Use of the Sentiment Score function results in sending data outside of Appian Cloud's FedRAMP, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS in-scope service boundaries. Customers should use caution when using a!sentimentScore() with regulated data, and review for their own compliance requirements.

This function is available only on Appian Cloud and will be enabled on Cloud sites on a rolling basis. You will receive the following error until your site is enabled: This function is currently unavailable. Please contact your system administrator if this problem persists.
Supported text values


Supports US English text only.


Single large text values will typically not provide useful sentiment scores. For best results, split large values into a list of smaller values that are each about the length of a sentence.


Examples
You can copy and paste these examples into the Expression Rule Designer to see how this works.

=a!sentimentScore({"Hi, I hope you're having a great day"})

  {0.79}

Negative sentiment score
sail 
=a!sentimentScore({"I got the wrong shipment!"})
returns

    {-0.53}

Returning sentiment scores for multiple statements at once
sail 
=a!sentimentScore(
  {
    "I lost my wallet and was having a horrible day!",
    "Then someone returned it to me and I was so happy!"
  }
)
returns

  {-0.73, 0.72}
