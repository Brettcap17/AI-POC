Function
{% include fncsyntax.html %}
{{ page.excerpt }}
See also: index(): This function acts as an alias to the property() function especially when applied over custom data types.
Parameters
{% include parameter_table.html parameters=page.parameters header=page.reftype %}
Returns
Any Type
Usage considerations
If the named property is not present, then the value for the valueIfMissing parameter is returned instead.
The value type of the valueIfMissing parameter should be the same type as the expected propertyâ€™s type.
For example, property(msg!properties,"someStringProperty","Missing Text") returns "Missing Text" if someStringProperty does not exist.
When the bean is a dictionary, if the nameOfProperty is not found in the dictionary, the valueIfMissing will be ignored and a null value will be returned. Consider using a map instead of a dictionary.
Examples
You can copy and paste these examples into the Expression Rule Designer to see how this works.
property(msg!properties,"name","no name was sent") returns no name was sent when the name property is not received in a message.
