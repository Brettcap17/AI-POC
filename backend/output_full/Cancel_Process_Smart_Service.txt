Runtime Behavior
When this smart service runs, the specified process will be canceled. This matches the behavior as if the user clicked the Cancel button from the Monitor view, which means that all process flow stops, all tasks for the process are removed from user's task lists, and the end events of the process do not execute.  The user who executed the smart service will be listed in the process's history as having canceled the process. Additionally, for processes that have already been canceled, an error will not be thrown.
