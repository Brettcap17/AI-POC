How to configure multiple validations for a single component

Expression
sail 
a!localVariables(
  local!varA,
  a!formLayout(
    label: "Example: Multiple Validation Rules on One Component",
    contents:{
      a!textField(
        label: "Text",
        instructions: "Enter at least 5 characters, and include the @ character",
        value: local!varA,
        saveInto: local!varA,
        validations: {
          if(len(local!varA)>=5, null, "Enter at least 5 characters"),
          if(isnull(local!varA), null, if(find("@", local!varA)<>0, null, "You need an @ character!"))
        }
      )
    },
    buttons: a!buttonLayout(
      primaryButtons: a!buttonWidget(
        label: "Submit",
        submit: true
      )
    )
  )
)
Test it out

Type fewer than 5 characters and click "Submit".
When testing offline, the form queues for submission but returns the validation messages when you go back online and the form attempts to submit.
Type more than 5 characters but no "@" and click "Submit".
