Overview
The Reconcile Doc Extraction node allows you to assign an interface to review and update extracted data from a doc extraction run, started by the Start Doc Extraction Smart Service.
The Appian Document Extraction page walks you through how to use document extraction functionality together in a process model. See the following list for the other smart services and functions you need to use with the Reconcile Doc Extraction Smart Service:
- Start Doc Extraction Smart Service
- a!docExtractionStatus()
- a!docExtractionResult()
- Admin Console > Document Extraction

Data tab
This tab displays all the Node Inputs and Node Outputs for the Service Node. You can add additional inputs and outputs, if needed. 
Node inputs
The default inputs are:



Input
Data Type
Required
Multiple
Description




Document Extraction Id
Integer
Yes
No
ID of the doc extraction run. In order to retrieve the results, a run must first be started by the Start Doc Extraction Smart Service and a!docExtractionStatus() function should return `COMPLETE`.


Data Type Number
Integer
Yes
No
Data Type Number is the type to which the values should be cast. 
  
This should be a Custom Data Type (CDT).
This may be retrieved by using `typeof(x)`, where x is a value of the intended type.




Title
Text

No
Text for the title of the interface. Default is `Reconcile [name of document]`.



Submit Button Label

Label for the “Mark as Invalid” button. Default is `Mark as Invalid`.


Is Structured Doc
Boolean
No

Set to true when fields to be extracted are in the same location for all documents. When you pass in structured documents and perform reconciliation, Appian Document Extraction learns to recognize this information based on its position, improving results for future extractions.



Node outputs

Name
Data Type
Description

Reconciled Data
Any Type
The data reconciled by the user. The data type will match the custom data type (CDT) number passed in the inputs.

To save the Reconciled Data into a process variable:

Select the Outputs property sheet (tab).
Click Reconciled Data on the Results list. The result properties are displayed.
Create a new process variable to store the result, or select an existing process variable with data type of your input Data Type Number from the available list.

Usage considerations
The doc extraction reconciliation interface can only be accessed by a user who has permissions to the original document.
Appian will delete document extraction runs after 30 days, or when the total amount of data surpasses 10 GB.  If you attempt to access a run that has been deleted, you will see an error.  Appian will not delete the documents you uploaded.
