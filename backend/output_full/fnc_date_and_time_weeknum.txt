1 is returned for any week that contains January 1st.
Usage considerations

The last days of the year will return 1 if the first day of the next year is within the same calendar week. For example, the date December 31, 2021 is on a Friday, so this will return 1 because the date January 1, 2022 is on the Saturday of that week.
