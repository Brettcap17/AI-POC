Overview
This endpoint runs an inspection on a package. Appian will return any deployment errors or warnings for a given package and import customization file.

HTTP Request Method: POST
Endpoint: /inspections

Request
When performing a POST request, you must define a request body using the multipart/form-data content type. Form data allows you to send key-value pairs and upload files, such as your package.
Each POST request’s body must include a JSON object (application/json content type) and form parameters (uploaded files). The JSON object is a list of key-value pairs, as listed below.
JSON object parameters

packageFileName - File name of the deployment package (.zip).
customizationFileName - File name of the import customization file (.properties).

Request example
In addition to the JSON object below, the request should have the referenced files attached.
Request
POST /inspections
JSON object example
json
{
   "packageFileName": "Fraud Investigation Management.zip",
   "customizationFileName": "Fraud Investigation Management.properties"
}
cURL example
If you’re calling the API from a command line interface, you can use cURL to make a request. The cURL command with the above JSON object and its corresponding files looks like:
curl --location --request
POST 'https://mysite.appiancloud.com/suite/deployment-management/v1/inspections' \
--header 'Appian-API-Key: <API key>' \
--form 'json="{
      \"packageFileName\": \"Fraud Investigation Management.zip\",
      \"customizationFileName\": \"Fraud Investigation Management.properties\"
   }"' \
--form 'zipFile=@"Fraud Investigation Management.zip"' \
--form 'ICF=@"Fraud Investigation Management.properties"'
Each form parameter requires a key name, as indicated by randomKey1, but these can be arbitrarily named and do not need to match anything in the JSON object.
