Multiple dropdown by index
Function: a!multipleDropdownFieldByIndex_20r2()
Displays a long list of choices from which the user may select none, one, or many items and saves the indices of the selected choices. To save a value instead of the index, use multiple dropdown.
Parameters
{% include parameter_table.html parameters=page.parameters header=page.reftype %}
Notes

If you set Label Position to "ADJACENT" or "ABOVE", but do not give a value for Label, a space still displays to the left-side or above, respectively, of the component as if there was a label displayed. To ensure the component appears to the far left when Label has no value, use "COLLAPSED" for Label Position.
Choices display in the same order as defined in the Choice Labels parameter. The Choice Labels argument cannot be null.
If a single item is selected, the system saves a single-item array.
If no selection is made, the system saves a null value into the component's Save Selection To field. If a single item is selected, the system saves a single-item array.
Choice index numbers start at 1. Indices passed Selected Indices cannot be less than 1 or greater than the length of the Choice Labels array.
The choices at the indices passed to the Selected Indices parameter display as selected by default. If null is passed to Selected Indices, none of the options are selected. However, if a list is passed to Selected Indices, it cannot contain a null value.
