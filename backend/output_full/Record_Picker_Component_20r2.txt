Record picker
Function: a!pickerFieldRecords()
Displays an autocompleting input for the selection of one or more records, filtered by a single record type. Suggestions and picker tokens use the title of the record.
Parameters
{% include parameter_table.html parameters=page.parameters header=page.reftype %}
Notes

Suggestions are based on the fields used in the record title. This is equivalent to the search functionality in a feed-style record list.
If you are having trouble getting your record picker to work for a service-backed record type, make sure the record list search is working correctly. See the Service-Backed Record Type Tutorial for an example of how to configure this.
Only records that the viewing user has permissions to see appear in the suggestions list, as determined by the default filters in the record type.
All selected record tokens include a link to the record.
Any nulls in the array passed to Selected Records are not displayed. A [Not Available] token is displayed for any invalid identifiers in the Selected Records array.
The component always saves an array regardless of how many selections have been made.
Whether placeholder text clears on focus or input varies by device and browser. 
This picker cannot be used to selected records of a rule-backed record type (deprecated).

Examples
The examples below use the "Employee" record type for the purpose of illustration only. If you copy and paste the expression below into an interface definition or Expression Mode, it will not evaluate in your Test Interface. Use it as a reference only.
