Expression
sail 
a!localVariables(
  local!rating: 0,
  local!totalStars: 10,
  a!richTextDisplayField(
    value: {
      a!foreach(
        items: enumerate(local!totalStars) + 1,
        expression: {
          a!richTextIcon(
            icon: if(
              fv!index <= local!rating,
              "star",
              "star-o"
            ),
            color: "ACCENT",
            linkstyle: "STANDALONE",
            link: a!dynamicLink(
              value: if(local!rating=fv!index, 0, fv!index),
              saveInto: local!rating
            )
          )
        }
      )
    }
  )
)
Test it out

Click on a random star. Notice that this and all previous stars will fill in.
Click on another random star. Notice that the total number of stars will change.
Click on the same star again. Notice that the stars will reset to zero. 

Notable implementation details

The calculation does no rounding on the score. Any score between two whole numbers will receive a partial star. This can be easily adjusted in the second if() statement, providing a different value than 1 when running the index comparison against local!score.
