    description: |
      The test-run ID for the test run you want to check on.

If you want to get the results of a test run, use a!testRunResultForId(). To learn about starting a test run, see a!startRuleTestsAll(), a!startRuleTestsApplications().
Test runs can only be queried by the user who initiated the test run, or a user of type System Administrator.
Results from a test run expire after 7 days. After 7 days, an error will be returned indicating that the test run has been deleted. If you'd like to persist this data for a longer period of time, you will need to write this data into a table in your business data source.

The following statuses can be returned:

COMPLETE: All test cases have been executed, and the results are ready to be retrieved with a!testRunResultForId().
IN PROGRESS: Not all test cases have been executed yet.

Error Scenarios

INVALID ID
The ID provided does not match an active test run.
The user lacks sufficient privileges to see the results (the user isn’t an administrator and the test run wasn’t initiated by them).



Example
a!testRunStatusForId(25)
Where 25 is a valid test-run ID.
See the Common Uses section of Expression Rule Testing Functions page for more examples.
