Usage considerations
Record IDs for different source types

For record types that use a database as the source, record ID is the primary key in the data store entity.
For record types that use a web service as the source, record ID is the value returned to the ID field produced by the record's source expression.
For record types that use a process model as the source, record ID is the ID for the process.

Example
Record type object references are specific to each environment. If you copy and paste these examples into your interface, they will not evaluate. Use them as a references only.
a!toRecordIdentifier(recordType: recordType!Employee, identifier: {"536870111", "536870555"}) returns an array of two Record Identifier values with the first pointing to the first record in the identifiers list and the second pointing to the second record.
