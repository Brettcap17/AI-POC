Usage considerations
Suggestions and permissions

Suggestions are based on the fields used in the record title. This is equivalent to the search functionality in a feed-style record list.
If you are having trouble getting your record picker to work for a service-backed record type, make sure the record list search is working correctly. See the Service-Backed Record Type Tutorial for an example of how to configure this.
Only records that the viewing user has permissions to see appear in the suggestions list, as determined by the default filters in the record type.

Selections and placeholders

Any nulls in the array passed to selected records are not displayed. A [Not Available] token is displayed for any invalid identifiers in the selected records array.
The component always saves an array regardless of how many selections have been made.
By default, all selected record tokens include a link to the record unless showRecordLinks is false. Consider setting showRecordLinks to false when selecting reference data from the picker. See Select a record from a record type without a link to the record for an example.
This picker cannot be used to selected records of a rule-backed record type (deprecated).
Whether placeholder text clears on focus or input varies by device and browser. 

Examples
Record type object references are specific to each environment. If you copy and paste these examples into an interface, they will not evaluate. Use them as a references only.
