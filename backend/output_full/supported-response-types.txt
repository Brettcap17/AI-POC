This page provides the supported response types for your connected system plug-in.
When returning an IntegrationResponse to the designer, you need to provide a Map<String,Object>. The table below details what Java types are supported as values in the Map and the associated Appian types to which they're converted.
| Java Type | Appian Type |
| int| Number (Integer) |
| double | Number (Decimal) |
| boolean | Boolean |
| java.lang.Number | Number (Decimal) |
| java.lang.String | Text |
| java.sql.Date | Date |
| java.sql.Time| Time |
| java.util.Date | Date and Time |
| java.util.Map<String,Object> where the values' types are in this table | Dictionary |
| java.util.Collection where the values' types are in this table | Array |
| Array where the values' types are in this table | Array |
