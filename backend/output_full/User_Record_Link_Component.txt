Usage considerations
Changing and deactivating usernames

User record links can be created for both active and deactivated users.
User record links continue to work when the user's username changes as long as the "user" field was configured by referencing a variable (e.g. process variable) rather than a username string.

Using user record links with other components
User record links can be used inside :

links
grid text columns
document images
user images
web images
chart series
tag items
rich text
styled icons
card layouts
milestones

Examples
Copy and paste an example into the INTERFACE DEFINITION in EXPRESSION MODE to see it displayed.
Record type object references are specific to each environment. If you copy and paste these examples into your interface, they will not evaluate. Use them as a references only.
