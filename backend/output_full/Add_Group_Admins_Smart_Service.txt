Configuration options
This section contains tab configuration details specific to this smart service. For more information about common configurations see the Process Node Properties page.
Data tab
This tab displays the node inputs and node outputs for the service node. You can add additional inputs and outputs, if needed. 
Node inputs
The default inputs are:
| Input | Data Type | Required | Multiple|
| - | - | - | - |
| New Administrators (Users) | User | Yes | Yes |
| Group | Group | Yes | No |
If the node is run without being assigned to a user (or a group) you must specify values for each of the Node Inputs listed in the table above. You can either manually enter data into the text-field, or a value can be generated using the Expression Editor. When using the Expression Editor, you can reference and modify Process Variables, rules, constants, and other data. The expressions then populate your Node Input values.
If the node is assigned, the Node Input values are typed by your assigned user(s) into a form.
a!addAdminsToGroup()
The Add Group Admins smart service is available as an expression function that can be executed inside a saveInto on a Interface Component or as part of a Web API.
