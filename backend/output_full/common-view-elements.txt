Toolbar
The toolbar is present in all views that contain grids. It is located immediately above the grid. When you select one or more objects in the grid, actions you can perform on those objects display in the toolbar.
The More menu in the toolbar includes additional actions that you'll probably use less often than the other toolbar actions. It is available in the Objects view, the Build view, and within any group or folder.
