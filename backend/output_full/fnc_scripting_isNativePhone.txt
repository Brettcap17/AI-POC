The isNativePhone() function has been deprecated, and will be removed in a future release of Appian. Instead, use the a!isPageWidth() function to more easily optimize responsive UIs for phone width or the a!isNativeMobile() function to conditionally change a component's behavior based on if the user is on the Appian Mobile application.
For information about the isNativePhone() Function, see the Appian 20.3 documentation.
