Overview
This page describes what you can do in the Deploy view in Appian Designer.
To access this view, click Deploy in the navigation pane at the environment level or in an application.
When you access this view at the environment level, it contains information about deployments in the current environment. When you access this view from within an application, it contains information about deployments in the current application.
Purpose
The Deploy view provides a single location for you to see and manage both incoming and outgoing deployments.
{% comment %}
You can determine the status of each deployment at a glance, view additional details for each deployment, review an incoming deployment, download a successful deployment package, re-deploy a successful incoming deployment to a higher environment, or view errors for an unsuccessful deployment.
{% endcomment %}

Tabs
Go to either of the following tabs:

The INCOMING tab displays all deployments and deployment requests that have come into your current environment.
The OUTGOING tab displays all the deployments and deployment requests that have been sent from your current environment to a different target environment.

Each tab features a toolbar and a deployments grid.

View the deployments grid
To view the deployments grid, click Deploy in the navigation pane. The INCOMING tab is open by default.
What's available
The deployments history includes packages deployed using the following methods:

Compare and Deploy (Direct)
Programmatic via APIs (External)
Export and Import (Manual)
Automated Deployment Manager{: target="blank"}

Imports of Admin Console settings, such as environment branding, are tracked in the Import History page of the Admin Console.
Security
Application security and reviewer group membership determine who can see and review packages in the Deploy view. 
By default, system administrators and users in the reviewer group can see all requests in the incoming and outgoing tabs. Application administrators, editors, and viewers will be able to see requests in both tabs for specific applications if they have the appropriate permissions. Application administrators and system administrators can also add a post-deployment process within a specific application.
The following table displays the available deployment activities and their permissions:
| Activity | System Administrators | Reviewer Group | Application Administrator | Application Viewers and Editors |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| View deployment history   | Yes   | Yes   | Yes, for specific apps   | Yes, for specific apps   |
| View deployment request details (object names, database scripts, import customization file)  | Yes   | Yes   | Yes, for specific apps   | No   |
| Approve updates to existing applications   | Yes   | Yes   | Yes, for specific apps   | No   |
| Approve deployment of a new application  | Yes   | Yes   | No   | No   |

View deployment details
To view details of an individual deployment, click on the deployment name in the deployments grid.
The deployment details are highlighted in the following image. Some sections in the deployment details, such as DATABASE SCRIPTS (6) or DECISION (3), may not appear if they do not apply to a package or environment. 
{% include zoompic.html url="images/deployments-details-annotated.png" border="-nb" %}
| # | Element | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Package overview | Lists the name, description, link to an external project management ticket, and post-deployment process (if one is added to the application). |
| 2 | Package details | Lists the status, deployment log link, application(s), source or target environment, requester, and requested/submitted time. | 
| 3 | Decision | A reviewer can approve or reject an incoming deployment request in this section. After a decision has been confirmed, this section displays the review decision and comments. This section only appears when you enable deployment approvals. |
| 4 | Objects | The list of objects in the package, and their status when comparing them to the current environment at the time of the deployment request. You can filter the list by object type and status. |
| 5 | Plug-ins | The list of plug-ins in the package. You can filter the list by status. |

| 7 | Import customization file |  Displays a link to download the original file or an option to upload a new file. |
| 8 | Inspection Results | Displays any missing precedents and warnings detected in the package from the most recent inspection. Inspection results are only available for direct deployments. The status will update if you click INSPECT AGAIN. |
| 9 | Pipeline | Tracks the environments to which the package has been deployed. To show up here, the environments must be connected and related deployments must have used the Deploy to Another Environment option. |
Review deployment requests
If you want to approve deployments to higher environments before theyâ€™re applied, select the Require Review option in the Admin Console. This option requires an Appian developer to approve each incoming deployment request in the environment and it also allows you to set up a reviewer group. Appian recommends creating a reviewer group to ensure that the appropriate developers have permission to approve all incoming deployments (including new applications).
System administrators, application administrators, or the specified reviewer group can comment on and approve or reject incoming deployments in the Deploy view. When a deployment is requested and approval is required, an email is sent to the application administrators and members of the reviewer group. 
Deploy existing packages
Once a package has been successfully deployed, you can reuse it for another environment. This is helpful for deploying packages to higher environments after testing your changes in a lower environment. The same set of changes will be applied to ensure that you are making consistent updates across all of your environments.

View archived deployments
Deployment packages can be periodically cleaned up based on your environment's Data Retention settings. Once a package is deleted, the corresponding deployment still appears in the history, but the deployment is archived and has limited functionality. 
For direct deployments, you can view a limited set of details for archived deployments. The objects list, package download, and inspection results are not available. Archived direct deployments also cannot be reviewed or deployed to another environment.
For manual deployments, details of archived deployments are not available.
