Overview
This page provides standard Appian design objects and object property naming conventions that you can adapt to your environment and organizational guidelines as needed. The design objects and properties in this page are listed in the order they appear in the NEW menu in the Build view.

appian-style-note
For many design objects, we recommend starting object names with a short, unique prefix specific to the related application. Initialisms, such as HRO for an HR Onboarding application, work well as application prefixes. You can specify the prefix you want to use when you create an application from scratch, and the prefix will pre-populate name fields for certain objects. 

Application



Object
Naming Standard
Example




Application


Published applications contain navigation items that are visible to end users. For example, Appian uses the application name to group together Actions in Tempo. If you intend to publish your application to users, do not use the application prefix in the name. Instead, use a short, descriptive name that is meaningful to end users. 
Unpublished applications are commonly used to promote artifacts between environments. If you don't intend to publish your application to end users, start the name with the application prefix. In addition, the name should include the following:

The type of the application, for example, CDTs and Data Stores or All Contents.
A version number as a suffix, such as v1.0.


For both published and unpublished applications, the name can be the same as another object's name in the same environment.




unpublished: HRO HR Onboarding All Contents v1.0
published: HR Onboarding





Data objects



Object
Naming Standard
Example




Data Store


Start the name with the application prefix.
Use title case with spaces.
The name must be unique in the Appian environment.



HRO Employee Data



Custom Data Type


Start the name with the application prefix.
Use title case with underscores.
Names must start with a letter or an underscore, and may contain only letters, numbers, hyphens, periods, and underscores.
The name must be unique in the Appian environment.
Use a custom namespace for your CDTs to group them and associate them with a specific application.




name: HRO_Employee_Data
namespace: urn:appian:hro




Record Type


Start the name with the application prefix.
Use a short, descriptive, singular name. Appian creates a plural name (without the prefix) that is displayed to end users.
The name must be unique in the Appian environment.



HRO Employee




Process objects



Object
Naming Standard
Example




Process Model


For most process models, process model folders, and running process instances, start the name with the application prefix. However, if you've configured a related action to use the process model name for the action's display name, don't use the prefix in the process model name.
Use title case with spaces.
For running process instances, include key data points in the name to help identify the process instances in a process report.
The name can be the same as another object's name in the same environment.




main process model: HRO Onboard New Employee
running instance: HRO Onboard John Doe - 2014 01 01 




Process Report


Start the name with the application prefix.
Use title case with spaces.
The name can be the same as another object's name in the same environment.



HRO Process Report



@Future writer: Please leave Robotic Processes as the last row in this table; it connects to the RPA link under the table.
Robotic Processes


Start the name with the application prefix.
If the robotic process isn't associated with an Appian application, use a prefix that can be used for all related object names.
The name must be less than 100 characters.
Use letters, numbers, underscores, periods, and dashes only.
The name must be unique in the Appian environment.

User objects

Naming Standard

Interface


Start the name with the application prefix.
Use Pascal case.
Do not use special characters or spaces.
Use an underscore between the application prefix and the rest of the name.
The name must be unique in the Appian environment.



HRO_AddNewEmployee



Report


Do not start the name with the application prefix, because the name is intended to be seen directly by end users.
Use a short, descriptive name that is meaningful to the end users.
Because a report is composed of several graphical elements (grids and charts) as well as editable fields used to filter and sort the report data, the report name should not be narrowed down to a specific timeframe or subset of the data.
Do not suffix the report name with Report.
The name can be the same as another object's name in the same environment.



HR Onboarding Department



Site


Start the name with the application prefix; the site name is internal and won't be seen directly by end users.
For the site display name, don't start the site display name with the application prefix, because end users will see it directly in the site navigation menu and browser tab.

Use a short site display name that is meaningful to end users.
Use title case for site display names.
When you create a site, Appian uses the site display name to construct a web address identifier for the site by default. To define the site URL, edit the default web address identifier. The web address identifier must be unique.
After you've created a site, the web address identifier (URL) won't automatically update if you edit the site display name or define it using an expression.





Site Name: HRO Onboarding
Site Display Name: Onboarding




Portal


Start the name with the application prefix; the portal object name is internal and won't be seen directly by end users.
For the portal display name, don't start the name with the application prefix, because end users will see it directly in the browser tab.

Use a short display name that is meaningful to end users of the portal.
Use title case for portal display names.
When you create a portal object, Appian uses the portal display name to construct a default web address identifier for the portal. To define the portal web address, edit the default web address identifier. The web address identifier must be unique in the current environment and any environments that you deploy the portal to. For more information on portal web addresses, see Portal Object. 
After you've created a portal object, the web address identifiers won't automatically update if you edit the portal display name.





Portal Object Name: HRO Registration
Portal Display Name: Account Registration

Create a parent group named for each application.
Name child groups according to their security role.
Each application should include the following child groups at a minimum:

Application Administrators

If you include the file extension in the name, make sure it matches the file type by which the file was saved. If the extension in the name does not match with the uploaded file, it may not display properly.
The name can be the same as another object's name in the same environment.



HRO_ProfilePhoto_Employee223



Folder


These recommendations apply to all folder types, including knowledge centers and document folders.
Start the name with the application prefix.

Use standard names across applications for folders that serve the same purpose. For example, you would use HRO Process Models to store process models in the HRO application.
For rule folders, the name must be unique in the Appian environment. For any other type of folder, the name can duplicate another name.

Action


These recommendations apply to application actions (visible in the Actions tab in Tempo) and record actions (visible in record views).
Do not start the name with the application prefix, because the name is intended to be seen directly by end users. For example, in Tempo, application actions are grouped by application names using filters, and in record views, record action names appear in buttons and links.
Use a short, descriptive name that is meaningful to the end users.




application action: Start New Employee Onboarding
record action: Update Employee
