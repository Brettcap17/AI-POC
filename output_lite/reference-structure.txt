Component plug-ins are packaged in ZIP files. This page describes the required ZIP structure.

appian-style-tip
This version of Appian supports component plug-ins that use SDK version 2.0.0. Refer to the Integration SDK compatibility table for version details.

Package structure
The folder structure of your component plug-ins references properties from the plug-in manifest file including the component's rule-name and version attributes. 

 Plug-in, packaged as a ZIP file
 appian-component-plugin.xml - Component plug-in package manifest
 Component folder, one for each component rule-name defined in the plug-in
 Component version folder, one for each major version (For example: v1, v2)
 Plug-in web content, including HTML, JS, CSS, etc. files. The HTML file used as the component's html-entry-point should be placed in this folder. Use subfolders for organization.
 Internationalization bundles (For example: <rule-name>_en_US.properties)



Notes

The appian-component-plugin.xml manifest file and all component rule name folders must be at the root directory of the zip file.
All paths for web content should be relative to its version folder as it will be unpacked into separate directories inside the container on deployment.
Internationalization bundles are removed from the folder structure when the plug-in is deployed. Don't reference these files in your code.
